<h1><em>Devotion 9 - Blessing of Correction </em></p><p>How can correction be a blessing?</h1><p>Admonition and reproof seem to be saying that there is some defect in our knowledge, our behaviour, or our character, and we need to change.  Most people resist change; thus, we tend to resist correction. However, if God has given us instruction to correct others and on how we should respond to the correction of others, then God considers admonishment, reproof, rebuke, and correction to be vital in our Christian growth.  </p><p>The defining question is, how much are we willing to lay aside mistaken ideas, views and beliefs if we are shown a better way and clearer truth?  Are we humble and willing to unlearn and relearn?</p><h1><em>Fear of Offence</em></h1><p>Many disciple makers are afraid to offend out of love. However, if we truly love, we should create a culture in the discipleship that allows us to speak into each other’s lives and give and take correction in a gentle manner without either one taking offence.</p><p>Rom.15:14 - “Concerning you, my brethren, I myself am convinced that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able also to<em> </em><strong><em>admonish one another</em></strong><em>”</em></p><p>Admonishment is essential to spiritual growth. Sometimes people need to be awakened to their spiritual needs and knowledge of God’s plan. The Scriptures frequently emphasize the benefits of receiving counsel and admonition. </p><p>Prov.27:5-6 - “Better is open <strong><em>rebuke</em></strong> than love that is concealed. Faithful are the <strong><em>wounds</em></strong> of a friend” </p><p>This speaks of love that offers us a rebuke, and the faithful wounds of a friend.  Yes, this rebuke may give us a “wound” but the outcome can be positive. </p><p>Ps.141:5 - “Let the righteous <strong><em>smite me in kindness </em></strong>and <strong><em>reprove</em></strong> me; it is <strong><em>oil upon the head</em></strong>; do not let my head refuse it” </p><p>In this case, the admonition is likened to being smitten but the result is refreshing and positive.  We should highly prize a friend’s willingness to point out our errors and failings in a loving way.  </p><p>Prov.28:23 - “He who rebukes a man will afterward find more favour than he who <strong><em>flatters with the tongue</em></strong>”. </p><p>Eccl.7:5: “It is better to listen to the <strong><em>rebuke of a wise man</em></strong> than for one to listen to the song of fools.” </p><p>If we value truth and sincerely desire change toward increasing holiness, we will definitely crave this correction more than a false friend who flatters us hypocritically.</p><p>Prov.17:10 - “A single rebuke does more for a <strong><em>person of understanding</em></strong> than a hundred lashes on the back of a fool.”</p><p>Jer.17:9 - “The <strong><em>heart is more deceitful</em></strong> than all else and is <strong><em>desperately sick</em></strong>; who can understand it”.  </p><p>Prov.28:26 - “He who <strong><em>trusts in his own heart is a fool</em></strong>, but he who walks wisely will be delivered”.  </p><p>No one is infallible. Since we cannot fully know ourselves, it is wise to be open enough to consider others’ sincere insights and inputs into our lives.</p><p>Prov.15:5, 31-32 - “He who regards reproof is <strong><em>sensible</em></strong>…whose ear <strong><em>listens</em></strong> to the life-giving <strong><em>reproof</em></strong> will <strong><em>dwell among the wise</em></strong>. But whoever ignores instruction <strong><em>despises himself</em></strong>, but he who listens to reproof gains intelligence”. </p><p>If we are sensible and a person of understanding, we will respond to a rightful rebuke with good attitude for our wellbeing and growth, or do we react to reproof and admonition and express our ignorance and foolishness. </p><p>Offering reproof to others and receiving reproof from others can be sensitive and difficult issues.  But let us approach both of these with a serious concern for God’s will, God’s truth, God’s righteousness, and God’s glory.</p><h1><em>Speaking the Truth in love to Build Up</em></h1><p>Eph.4:15 – “<strong><em>Speaking the truth in love</em></strong>, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head – Christ<sup> </sup>from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, <strong><em>causes growth of the body</em></strong> for the edifying of itself in love.”</p><p>Generally, this verse is often used to remind us of the need to share difficult truths in a gentle, kind, and inoffensive manner. And if rebuke is necessary, it should be done with tenderness, humility and sensitivity, never with arrogance and harshness. However, if we observe the context carefully, it gives us deeper insight on what it means to “speak the truth in love.”</p><p>In the verses prior to this command, Paul writes about unity in the <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/body-of-Christ.html">body of Christ</a> and he urges us to “live a life worthy of the calling we have received” (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%204.1" target="_blank">Eph.4:1</a>).</p><p>Later, He talks about Christ giving to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers “to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%204.12%E2%80%9313" target="_blank">Eph.4:11–13</a>).</p><p>Paul’s instruction in this whole chapter centred around doctrinal issues and is directly applicable to the growth and edification of fellow believers (vs.16). Thus, the issue he was addressing is the adherence to true doctrine, so that we will not be deceived by false doctrine. Hence, it is in this context of church unity and spiritual maturity that Paul exhorted us to speak the truth in love.</p><p>Hence, our call to speak the truth in love is gospel oriented. We are to speak the truth, which contrasts with the falsehood of deceptive teachings, unscriptural world view and worldly philosophies; and we are to do so in love for the purpose of building up the body of Christ. We need to differentiate between being dogmatic, and uncompromised truth. If not, many false doctrines and heresies will be left unchallenged.</p><h1>Prov.10:17 - “He who keeps instruction is in the way of life, but he <strong><em>who refuses correction goes astray</em></strong>.”</h1><h1>Prov.12:1 - “Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge, but he who <strong><em>hates correction is stupid.</em></strong>”</h1><h1>Prov.29:1 - “He who is often <strong><em>rebuked, and hardens his neck</em></strong>, will <strong><em>suddenly be destroyed</em></strong>, and that <strong><em>without remedy</em></strong>.”</h1><p>When the Bible instructs us to correct, reproof or rebuke one another, it is regarded as a great act of love, with the kind intention to stop us from continuing a destructive path. However, our motivation to do so must be characterized in love and not pride. </p><p>It is important to note that “speaking the truth in love” is different from “loving to speak the truth”. The former is motivated by love while the latter could be motivated by self-righteousness. Everybody wants to be loved and therefore correction must be accompanied with compassion rather than an attitude of superiority. We all need to learn the skill of showing love. It is not merely about “what” to correct; but “how” to correct. </p><h1><em>Reparenting as Spiritual Mentor</em></h1><p>As a discipler, we have a relatively parental role. If we never correct those we disciple, we do not love them. If we truly love them, we will tell them the truth.</p><h1>1 Thess.2:10-11 – “You <em>are</em> witnesses, and God <em>also,</em> how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we behaved ourselves among you who believe; as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, <strong><em>as a father does his own children</em></strong>…”</h1><h1>2 Tim.3:16-17 –<strong> </strong>“<strong><em>All Scripture</em></strong> is given by inspiration of God, and is <strong><em>profitable for doctrine</em></strong>, <strong><em>for reproof, for correction</em></strong>, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.”</h1><p>2 Tim.4:2 - “Preach the word. Be ready in season and out of season. <strong><em>Reprove, rebuke</em></strong>, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching” </p><p>As followers of Christ, we are to uphold the truth of God’s revealed Word. That means there will be times when we must confront error as we contend for the faith. Biblical love “does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth” (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Cor.%2013.6" target="_blank">1 Cor. 13:6</a>). Our postmodern world wrongly equates love with tolerance of all beliefs and actions. But being tolerant of doctrinal error or unrepentant sin is not truly loving at all. Love and truth go hand in hand. If we truly love, we will want to build one another up in the truth. At times, speaking the truth can be the most loving thing we can do. </p>
