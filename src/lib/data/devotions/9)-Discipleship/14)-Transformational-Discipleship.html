<h1>14) Devotion 14 - Transformational Discipleship</h1><h1>Matt. 28:19-20 – “Go therefore and <em>make disciples</em> of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to <em>observe all things that I have commanded </em>you; and lo, I am with you always, <em>even</em> to the end of the age.” Amen”</h1><p>Many people equate discipleship with knowledge, but the essence of discipleship is transformational not informational. Jesus did not merely ask us to teach everything He commanded. He asked us to teach people to obey everything He commanded, and this difference is vital. The end result of discipleship is not merely the knowledge of all Jesus commanded but the obedience to all Jesus commanded. It is obedience to His Word that brings about transformation in our life.</p><p>When a disciple maker’s primary goal is to transfer knowledge from one mind into another, this is informational discipleship, which is important and necessary. However, if our ministry stops there, we are just creating informed disciples. Instead, we need to be mindful about transformational discipleship, that is, focusing both on the intentional (teaching) and relational investment. We should not be satisfied with mere behavioural modification but rather, seeking transformation of their core values and priorities. </p><p>Relationships allow for the content of our core values and priorities to be observed in real life. When one sees how a transformed life is lived out in real life through relationships, then the potential for transformation in their own lives is exponentially multiplied. Talk is cheap but action is deep. Many precious and valuable life lessons are caught rather than taught.</p><h1><em>Authentic &amp; Transformed Lives </em></h1><h1><br />1 Cor.11:1 – “<em>Imitate me</em>, just as I also imitate Christ.”</h1><h1>Phil. 4:9 – “Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me—everything you <em>heard</em> from me and <em>saw me doing</em>” </h1><h1>Our ministry should flow from our own transformed lives, as we cannot expect to be used to transform others if we are not first transformed ourselves. Think of a time when we shared our wisdom, knowledge and life experiences with someone, with the hope that our teachings will influence their life values and priorities. This is not possible if our teachings are not in alignment with who we are and how we behave.</h1><p>We teach what we know, but we reproduce what we are. This philosophy is true for anyone who is in a position to influence others on a consistent basis. People will be more influenced over the long-term by what we do rather than by what we say. When we commit ourselves to becoming the right person, we will eventually produce the right people. In other words, we must first and foremost be an authentic disciple of Christ if we want to produce the right kind of disciples.</p><h1><em>Quality Time</em></h1><p><br />Many tend to do discipleship ministries in masses, through conducting classes or seminars. However, discipleship is about life impartation, and we cannot do it effectively through masses. We need to be intentional about meeting the felt needs of individuals. Jesus modelled the most effective form of disciple making by giving us the “with him principle”. </p><h1>Mk 3:14 – “Then He appointed twelve, that <em>they might be with Him</em> and that He might send them out to preach…”</h1><p>Having chosen the twelve men, He spent three years with them showing them how to live and lead in His kingdom. This was the essence of his training program, “life upon life”. Most lessons in life are usually learned through demonstration rather than explanation – “Monkey See, Monkey Do”, people do what people see.</p><h1><em>Work of the Holy Spirt</em></h1><p>Real transformation is not just doing or knowing something different; it is being someone different through the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives. Discipleship is about connecting people to God and teaching them how to continue healthily in that relationship. We can liken the discipleship journey to water skiing.</p><p>In water skiing, the person behind is not the one who lifts himself of the water, the boat has all the power. But the one with the skies on must also play a part. He must place himself in the right posture behind the boat and prepare the ride. Spiritual transformation is the same. God is the one enabling His people to mature and grow, while we must disciple His people with the skill on how to position themselves behind the boat in order to ride the journey of life successfully on this earth. </p><h1>Jer.17:9 -<sup> </sup>“The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked…”</h1><p>The human heart is not something pure that needs to be protected; it is something wicked that needs to be transformed. May we all play a part in helping one another in this remarkable process of transformation.</p>
