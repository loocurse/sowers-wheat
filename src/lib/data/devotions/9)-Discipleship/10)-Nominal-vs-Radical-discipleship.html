<h1>Devotion 10 - Nominal vs Radical Discipleship</h1><p>Being a Christian in the first century was countercultural. Christians were persecuted, killed, and even fed to beasts for sport in the Roman empire. To be a Christian, one had to be willing to give up everything for Christ. However, as time went on, Christianity became more acceptable and comfortable.  Sadly, this has bred and produced many nominal or cultural Christians, and biblical Christianity suffered. The line between the two also became muddled. So, what is the difference?</p><p>A nominal Christian is one who calls himself a Christian but has no authentic commitment to Christ.  They may be faithful in attending church regularly and an active member involved in Church affairs. However, Christ has no bearing in their lives and their “faith” does not go beyond being identified with a church, Christian group, or denomination. Their worldview and values remain unchanged. Many of them have their mind instructed, but their hearts are not transformed. Jesus is only their saviour but not the Lord of their life. They take a minimalist approach to their faith.<strong> </strong></p><h1>Rev.3:1-5 – “To the angel of the church in Sardis write, ‘These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: “I know your works, that <em>you have a name</em> that you are alive, but you are <em>dead</em>…”</h1><p>The Sardis church had a reputation of being active and alive but in reality, was spiritually dead. They were spiritual zombies - not alive, but somehow not dead. They were the walking dead.  They were what we would call "nominal Christians." They were Christians in name only but possessed no spiritual life. God is not interested in the labels we tag ourselves with. Having a “name” that we belong to Christ is not enough. Nominal faith is not faith. Biblical Christianity emphasizes a relationship with Christ. Those who adhere to nominal Christianity miss out on the true joy of Christianity: knowing God. </p><p>Tragically, the gospel often preached today made discipleship optional…therefore radical discipleship is rare and neglected. We need to awaken radical discipleship to challenge nominal Christianity.</p><h1><br /><em>What is Radical Discipleship?</em></h1><p>Eph.4:15 - “Growing in every way to become more and more like Christ, who is the head of the church.” </p><p>The essential meaning of the word “radical” is derived from the Latin word <em>radix,</em> meaning root. Thus, Radical Discipleship is not referring to some sort of extremist movement, but rather returning to the roots of Christianity, and to know what it really means to follow Jesus. Jeremiah in the Old Testament called it the ancient paths. </p><p>Jer. 6:16<strong> – </strong>“Stand at the crossroads and look;<strong> </strong>ask for the <strong><em>ancient paths</em></strong>,<strong> </strong>ask where the good way is, and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls…”</p><p>Radical disciples are rooted ones, under the discipline of Christ. At the root, it means we let Jesus set the agenda of our lives. We aren't selective. We don't pick and choose what is favourable and stay away from what is costly. If Jesus is not Lord of all, He is not Lord at all. Radical discipleship means being obedient to every command of Jesus, whether in our public life or private life. If Jesus is truly our Lord: He calls, we follow.</p><p>Thus, radical discipleship expresses the need for a re-orientation towards the essential core teachings of Jesus and to His kingdom values. It is allowing every facet of our life to be shaped by the teaching of Jesus, to return to His lordship and to put our faith into action. Being a radical Christian means giving up everything for God. Though God may require different things from different people, God demands to be the centre of our lives. All actions and thoughts are to be informed by allegiance to Him; He is to be our greatest joy and fulfilment.</p><p>Radical discipleship is more than just attending Church service, being committed to certain ministries, to be a faithful tither, etc. It is intentionally and mindfully seeking to “walk our talk”. If we are not intentional, we will be producing nominal Christianity, seeking only to feed our consumeristic soul. The word “disciple” can be so watered down in some churches that it means little more than a church membership class.  </p><h1><em>Small Group Setting</em></h1><h1>Heb.10:24-25 - “And let us <em>consider one another</em> in order <em>to stir up</em> love and good works, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as is the manner of some, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see <em>the Day approaching</em>.”</h1><p>Treasuring Christ together is the overarching vision of this scripture.  It also provides the biblical foundation of faith-sustaining care for one another Radical Discipleship is ideally formed in a safe, small, intimate community of faith where people “do life together” and feel comfortable exploring their personal and spiritual issues. The emphasis isn’t what happens in the head, but what happens in the heart. Knowledge of the truth does not transform us; it is the application of the truth that transforms us. Most of us are educated well beyond our level of obedience. Thus, many are well instructed in their mind, without the heart being transformed. It’s not what we know that will change the world; it is how we live out the Good News that will ultimately change the world.</p><p>We should not approach Christian fellowship with a consumeristic mindset, but rather with a giving attitude. The word “to consider” means to give careful consideration and to think carefully. And to “stir up” is to provoke a strong reaction, to spur one another on towards love and good works. </p><p>Too often, we can become lazy or complacent in our Christian lives and expect everyone else to take care of the work of the kingdom. Common statistics show that in many churches, 20% of the people are doing 80% of the work. Well, that means we have 80% of people in the churches that need to be “stirred up” to radical discipleship.</p><p>Sunday Church worship is a wonderful time to come together to worship God, but the focus is more on worship than fellowship. If we want to fulfil the “one another” commands, we must have small group fellowships for interpersonal interactions. </p><p>“The Day approaching…” refers to the day of Christ returning. That means our time for Christian fellowship has an expiration date. Either we expire or this world will expire, but either way, we have a limited time to do God’s work here on earth. And the way we live here on earth has eternal repercussions. Thus, it is vital to heed this “one another” command and stir up radical disciples for Christ.</p>
