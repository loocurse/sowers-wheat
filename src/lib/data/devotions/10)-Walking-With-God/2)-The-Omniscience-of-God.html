<h1><a id="_Hlk55807100"></a> Devotion 2 – Omniscience of God </h1><p>Omniscient means having infinite awareness, understanding and insight, complete, perfect and unlimited knowledge of all things. God does not need to learn anything new; He is the source of acknowledge, understanding and wisdom. His knowledge is simultaneous, not sequential. He knows all at once, the information is not given to Him in pieces. He already has it, from the beginning. He knows everything about everything. He knows everything that could happen or is going to happen under any kind of circumstances. He sees the end from the beginning; thus, He can have a perfect plan with predestined goals with flawless precision. He is the scribe writer, producer, and director of world history.</p><h1>Isa.46:9-10 - Remember the former things, those of long ago; I am God, and there is no other; I am God, and there is none like me. <em>I make known the end from the beginning, from ancient times, what is still to come</em>. I say, ‘<em>My purpose will stand, and I will do all that I please.”</em></h1><p>Our knowledge is limited, and our best efforts of understanding are finite. We are trapped by our own experiences in place and time. We cannot know the specifics of tomorrow and imagine every possibility of every situation, and thus, we are always fearful of the future. God sees the entire tapestry while we are only tangled up on one single thread. He sees and comprehends all sides of every angle, for all people, for all time and has it all planned out.</p><p>Omniscience is an inherent part of His character and being. Nothing is outside of God’s sphere of knowledge. He knows every person who has existed or ever will exist. He is as acquainted with the distant galaxies as He is with the numbers of hairs on our heads. Nothing can surprise Him or catch Him unaware. He is never blind-sided! He already knows. He already knows, not because He sees it coming and figures it out, it is because He ordains it. </p><p>A firm belief in God’s omniscience gives us extraordinary peace, security, and comfort in every area of life. We must mindfully allow this truth to impact our faith.</p><h1><strong><br /></strong><em>Resting in His Infinite Wisdom</em></h1><h1>Ps.147:5 – “Great <em>is</em> our Lord, and mighty in power; His <em>understanding is infinite</em>.”</h1><h1>What are the implications of God’s omniscience for us? Should it inspire fear or comfort?</h1><p>Because of this amazing character and attribute, God is infallible. He cannot make mistakes, cannot mess up. He does not even have to consult others besides Himself. God never has to agonize over a decision. He can bring every good out of evil, turning ashes to beauty. </p><p>This is incredibly assuring; it should be an immense source of hope and great comfort for us as believers.  Once we can fully grasp the enormity of this truth, it can change our whole perspective of life. God is fully aware of every event in our lives. God is never caught off guard by our failures or wrong decisions. He knows every potential outcome of every decision we make. Because of that, He is able to guide and direct our lives. </p><p>We are being handled by a wisdom which is perfect, a wisdom which can achieve what it intends - by taking hold of things and people which are meant for evil and making them work together for good. Our heart will be filled with gratitude and thanksgiving, resting in His wisdom and love.</p><p>Very often, we look at the wickedness, misery, injustice, painful situations and sufferings, and we wonder if God truly knows everything. We doubt His goodness and infinite wisdom.</p><p><br />God created all things, controls all things, and knows all things. Nothing slips through His grasp or past His awareness, ever.  Hence, there is perfect security for us to rest in His omniscience and trust in His love and grace to help guide us according to His will.  God’s knowledge is infinite, complete, and perfect. He knows everything about us, seen and unseen. There is nothing too hard for an omniscient God, and it is on this basis that we can rest secure in Him, knowing that His promises never fail us as long as we continue in Him. He has known us from eternity, even before creation.</p><h1>Eph.1:3-4 – “Blessed <em>be</em> the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly <em>places</em> in Christ, just as <em>He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world</em>, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love”</h1><h1>Ps.139:13-16 – “For You formed my inward parts; You covered me in my mother’s womb. <sup> </sup>I will praise You, for I am fearfully <em>and</em> wonderfully made; marvellous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well. My frame was not hidden from You, when I was made in secret, and skilfully wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.<sup> </sup><em>Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed</em>. And in Your book, they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when <em>as yet there were</em> none of them.”</h1><p>God understands our weaknesses, fears and insecurities, and needs. He knows exactly what we need to grow the peaceful fruit of righteousness and become the people He created us to be. Each of our stories are chapters in His great story. His perfect knowledge and wisdom will guide us to peace, health, and healing. </p>
