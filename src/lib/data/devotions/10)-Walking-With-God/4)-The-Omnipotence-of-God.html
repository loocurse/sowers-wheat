<h1>Devotion 4 - Omnipotence of God</h1><p>As with the attributes of omniscience and omnipresence, God is also omnipotent. God is not only all-knowing and all-seeing, but He is also infinite, sovereign and all-powerful. He always has power over all things, in every place, and in all ways throughout all time and all creation.</p><h1>Job 42:2 – “I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You.”</h1><p>The purposes of God cannot be frustrated. If this was possible, that would mean that there is a power greater than God. When this truth is truly impressed upon our heart, we will be empowered to face all of life’s circumstances, and the chaotic and uncertainty of the future. It will help us to stand and be unshakable above all that threatens to defeat and destroy us. No matter how vulnerable or ill-equipped we feel, no matter what challenges and problems we face, we can rest in the peace of God, knowing He is matchless in power, unconquerable, and always victorious. Our all-loving God is faithful. He reigns over all and holds us securely in His hand. </p><p>Indeed, God has complete and total control over everything. This includes the smallest details of the natural world, like the falling of a sparrow or the number of hairs that grow on your head (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Matt%206%3A26-30%2C%2010%3A29-30/" target="_blank">Matt.6:26-30, 10:29-30</a>). He determines what nations will dwell in which territory (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Acts%2017%3A26/" target="_blank">Acts 17:26</a>), He decides what king is to rule, and when, and where (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Isa%2044%3A28/" target="_blank">Isa.44:28</a>). He decides whether the purposes of a ruler will stand or fall (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Psa%2033%3A10-11/&quot; \t &quot;_blank">Psa 33:10-11</a>). So, His power is universal: it controls everything in the universe (<a href="https://www.esv.org/Lam%203%3A37-38/" target="_blank">Lam.3:37-38</a>, <a href="https://www.esv.org/Rom%208%3A28/" target="_blank">Rom.8:28</a>, <a href="https://www.esv.org/Eph%201%3A11/" target="_blank">Eph.1:11</a>, <a href="https://www.esv.org/Rom%2011%3A33-36/" target="_blank">Rom.11:33-36</a>). Jesus reminded Pilate that he had no power over Him unless it had been granted to him by the God of all power (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2019.11" target="_blank">Jn.19:11</a>).</p><h1>Col.1:16 – “For <em>by Him all things were created</em> that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. <em>All things were created through Him and for Him</em>.”</h1><p>God not only has ultimate power over all things, but He is also the source of all power. His self-sufficiency makes it unnecessary for Him to look outside of Himself. All the power required to do all that He wills is in His own infinite being. Though He sets limits on all of creation, He Himself is limitless in strength, wisdom, knowledge and power. He is the initiator of all that exists, the only uncaused entity in all of creation. </p><h2><em>God is Bigger than our Problems</em></h2><h1>Psa.139:16 – “You saw me before I was born. <em>Every day of my life was recorded in your book</em>. Every moment was laid out before a single day had passed.”</h1><p><a href="http://www.biblestudytools.com/search/?t=niv&amp;q=ps+27:1">Psa.27:1</a> - “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?”</p><p>Scripture tells us that every day of our lives was recorded in His book. This means, He knows every setback we will encounter and every challenge we will face. When we feel frightened and threatened by forces or circumstances beyond our control, we need to be mindful of the omnipotent God we serve. He is our strong tower and our fortress. God is bigger and stronger than whatever we might face. </p><h1>Col.2:15 – “Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.”</h1><h1>Every evil has already been conquered by our omnipotent, sovereign, all-knowing, and all-loving God. Christ’s death had defeated and shamed all the powers of darkness. But like Paul, we might continue to struggle with difficult circumstances and pain in our lives to the extent that we may even despair of life.</h1><h1>2 Cor.1:8 - “For we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of <em>our trouble</em> which came to us in Asia: that we were <em>burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life.</em>”</h1><h1>Troubles often cause us to doubt the omnipotence of God. In such times, we need to re-centre ourselves in Him and be reminded of the “incomprehensibility” of God. God is infinite and He is ultimately beyond our ability to fully understand but He is also loving and faithful. </h1><h2><em>Limitation to His Omnipotence </em></h2><p>Though omnipotent, God cannot do anything that is not in harmony with His Holy character and His nature. In other words, His omnipotence is contained within and expressed through His righteousness, love, mercy, truth, and grace. He cannot and will not do anything contradictory to who He is or what He had said. </p><h1>Titus1:2 - “In hope of eternal life which God, <em>who cannot lie</em>, promised before time began…”</h1><h1>Heb.6:18 – “That by two immutable things, in which <em>it is impossible for God to lie</em>, we might have strong consolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold of the hope set before <em>us.”</em></h1><h1>Hence, His promises and power are to be trusted without reservation. He can do anything according to His infinite ability, but He will only do what is consistent with His nature and character.</h1><h1>God has the power to remain exactly as He is for all time. He will always be gracious, good, loving, faithful, and compassionate, etc. There is no prayer too difficult for Him to answer, no need too great for Him to supply, no passion too strong for Him to subdue; no temptation too powerful for Him to deliver from, and no misery too deep for Him to relieve. He can handle any problem we have. </h1><h1>1 Pet.4:19 – “Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls <em>to Him</em> in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.”</h1><h1>This is our God – omniscient; omnipresent; omnipotent. Even amid our pain, we can always entrust ourselves to Him.</h1>
