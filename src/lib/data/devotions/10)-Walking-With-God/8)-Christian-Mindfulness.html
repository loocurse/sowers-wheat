<h1>Devotion 8 - Christian Mindfulness</h1><p>In modern times, many of us live a driven, intense, stressful, and distracted lifestyle. Our minds are often distracted from either the pain of the past or worries of the future, which lead to unnecessary stress, anxiety and even depression. Hence, chronic anxiety and depression are becoming a cultural pandemic. And tragically, even among Christians, many are not consciously aware and continue rushing through life mindlessly, not recognizing they could be the next victim.</p><h1><em>Definition of Mindfulness</em></h1><p>Mindfulness is a term used to describe a technique which helps with self-examination of one’s thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and emotions. In simple terms, it is a meditative technique that involves quietening the mind and becoming aware of our body and environment. The goal is to identify thoughts and feelings without being overly reactive or overwhelmed by the circumstances. The practice allows a person to just “be” in the present moment and not be distracted with the constant rush of thoughts. </p><p>The theory is that when we are mindful in the present, we can avoid the pitfalls of letting the past or the future hijack us from living and enjoying the moment. Some use the word grounding, watchfulness or self-awareness.</p><p>According to psychologists, “Mindfulness” is best defined as a mental and emotional state that allows the most thoughtful response from us in any given situation. It is not reactive; rather, it is thoughtful action. It is the opposite of being out of control.</p><h1><em>The Origins of Mindfulness</em></h1><p>At its beginning, mindfulness was always linked to Buddhism or Hinduism. However, because it has been practiced for thousands of years, and not recorded in any particular religion ancient text, it is difficult to determine the original roots. </p><p>Mindfulness has been practiced in the Western world for the past 40 years because of Jon Kabat-Zinn’s Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program published at the University of Massachusetts Medical School during the 1970’s. Since that time hundreds of studies have documented the mental health benefits of mindfulness practice. It improves attention, reduces stress and anxiety, improves emotional regulation and impulse control, helps relieve chronic pain, and heightens empathy and compassion. Some promising research even indicates it may be as effective as medication for preventing depression relapse. These concrete positive outcomes have spurred the growth of mindfulness practice in many clinical settings as a path for mental well-being.</p><p>As a result of his rigorous work, and the work of others, we see how the practice of mindfulness can change the brain at its chemical level, and ultimately even its anatomy, helping to reduce the symptoms of anxiety and depression. Since then, mindfulness has made a drastic transition - one from spirituality to psychology. In recent years, scientific research has also confirmed that practicing mindfulness is good for the body and soul. </p><h1><em>Can Christians Practice Mindfulness?</em></h1><p>I like what Dallas Willard said, “Just because Hindus eat breakfast doesn’t mean it’s a bad thing to do.” In my opinion, mindfulness can be non-religious. Nonetheless, can Christians safely practice mindfulness without going onto the wrong spiritual path? Can the Christian faith make sense of this practice and incorporate it into our spiritual discipline to enhance our walk with God and empower us to transform into Christlikeness? </p><h1><em>Are we Mindful of God?</em></h1><h1>Isa.17:10 – “Because you have <strong><em>forgotten the God of your salvation</em></strong><em>, and </em><strong><em>have not been mindful of the Rock of your stronghold</em></strong><em>,</em> therefore you will plant pleasant plants and set out foreign seedlings; In the day you will make your plant to grow, And in the morning you will make your seed to flourish; <strong><em>But the harvest will be a heap of ruins in the day of grief and desperate sorrow.”</em></strong></h1><p>Here God spoke to His people not in love but in displeasure because they had backslidden, they had fallen into the spirit of slumber and had not been mindful of Him as “God of their salvation” and the “Rock of their stronghold”. As a result, they reaped miserable consequences - the Lord bringing their hard work to nothing.</p><h1>2 Pet.3:1-2 – “Beloved, I now write to you this second epistle (in both of which I stir up your pure minds by way of reminder), that you may <strong><em>be mindful of the words</em></strong> which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the apostles of the Lord and Saviour…”</h1><p>From these two scriptures, we are in fact exhorted to be mindful, mindful of the His grace of salvation and protection, mindful of His ways and especially of His Words. Could Satan be using the worldview on mindfulness to rob us from the transformative work of Christ?</p><h1><em>Horizontal vs Vertical Mindfulness</em></h1><p>Secular mindfulness is personal and horizontal, focusing and only paying attention to ourselves. However, Christian mindfulness introduces a vertical dimension: we are paying attention to God and your relationship with Him. This is what makes Christian mindfulness utterly unique.</p><p>Many Christians lament about distractions in their prayer life. Our mind seems to get hijacked easily into unaccomplished task or mere worrying. The enemy wants to keep us distracted because distractions keep our minds anxious, stressed and thus condition us to be vulnerable to temptations. Practicing mindfulness can help us focus during prayer time and fight off anxious patterns of thought. </p><p>On its own, mindfulness is a powerful psychological tool, but it becomes especially powerful when combined with Christian faith because it braces us for divine connection and opens us to experience God’s presence in a deep and refreshing way.</p>
