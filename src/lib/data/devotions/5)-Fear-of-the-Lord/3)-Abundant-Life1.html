<h1>Devotion 3 - Abundant Life</h1><h1>Jn.10:10 - The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.”</h1><p>Many Christians are aware that Jesus came to give us abundant life. But as mentioned before, many gospel privileges or promises are not automatic to mere believers but rather to those who uphold the fear of the Lord in their lives.  Many assume that the promises and blessing of God come with salvation as a package, however, is not true. In fact, most of the promises of God come with conditions.  Let’s look at the scriptures below:</p><h1>Psalm 33:16-18 – “No king <em>is</em> saved by the multitude of an army; a mighty man is not delivered by great strength. <sup> </sup>A horse <em>is</em> a vain hope for safety; neither shall it deliver <em>any</em> by its great strength. Behold, the eye of the Lord <em>is</em> on those who fear Him, on those who hope in His mercy”</h1><p>The contrast here is not between the use of human means and reliance upon God, but between reliance on human means and on God. David was a warrior himself, so he appreciated the importance of these human means and used them. Yet his hope and reliance were in the Lord alone.  God’s sovereignty and human responsibility always work hand in hand, one does not work without the other.</p><h1>Prov.19:23 – “The fear of the Lord leads to life, and he who has it will abide in satisfaction; he will not be visited with evil.</h1><h1>The affirmation here is that we can only abide or remain in a life of “satisfaction” when we have the fear of God.  This is abundant life, a good life, a joyful life, a peaceful life, a productive life, an extended life, and ultimately eternal life. </h1><h1>Proverbs 14:27 - “The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to turn one away from the snares of death”</h1><h1>The snares of death are not merely the pitfalls and dangers of our present lives on earth; but they include the unspeakable terrors of the "second death."  And the fear of the Lord is the key to turn us away from a rebellious and destructive heart and keep us in the fountain of life, which depicts continuous abundance.</h1><h1>Proverbs 22:4 - “By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches and honour and life”.</h1><h1>Humility and the fear of the Lord are naturally associated. They are indeed inseparable, as one produces the other. Lowliness in spirit is an indispensable characteristic of a godly life. It is in the valley of contrition that the sinner first meets with God, and comes into a state of reconciliation with Him.  Pride cannot dwell in the same heart with the fear of the Lord which brings us riches, honour and abundant life.</h1><h1>Ps. 34:7-10 – “The angel of the Lord encamps all around those who fear Him, <br />and delivers them.<sup> </sup>Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; blessed is the man who trusts in Him! <sup> </sup>Oh, fear the Lord, you His saints! There is no want to those who fear Him.<sup> </sup>The young lions lack and suffer hunger; but those who seek the Lord shall not lack any good thing.</h1><h1>The abundant life includes protection by an angelic being as well as supernatural provision.</h1><p>Encamps<strong> – </strong>literally means “pitches his tent” so as to defend and to protect. The idea here is that the angel of the Lord protects those who walk in the fear of the Lord as just an army defends a country. He “pitches his tent” near them, and is there to guard them from danger. </p><p>Even the strongest animal in the animal kingdom suffers lack, but the one who walk in the fear of the Lord and a true seeker of God shall never be in lack.  In fact, the bible even promises that God stored up great things for those who fear Him.</p><p> Psalm 31:19 – “Oh, how<strong> great is your goodness</strong>, which you <strong>have laid up for those who fear you</strong>, which you have prepared for those who trust in you. </p><p>Last but not least, as we walk in the fear of the Lord, it brings unearthly and marvellous blessings and our testimony itself will inspires others to fear God. </p><h1>Psalm 40:1-3 – “I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined to me, and heard my cry.<br />He also brought me up out of a horrible pit, Out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my steps. <sup>3 </sup>He has put a new song in my mouth—Praise to our God; many will see <em>it</em> and fear, and will trust in the Lord.</h1><h1>Psalm 67:7 – “God shall bless us, and all the ends of the earth shall fear Him.”</h1><h1><strong>Consequences of not walking in the fear of the Lord </strong></h1><p>Prov.1:28-31 - “Then <strong>they will call on me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but they will not find me</strong>.<sup> </sup>Because they hated knowledge and <strong>did not choose the fear of the Lord,</strong><sup> </sup>they would have<strong> none of my counsel </strong><em>and</em> <strong>despised my every rebuke.</strong><sup> </sup>Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their own way, and be filled to the full with their own fancies.</p><p>This scripture speaks of men calling upon God, and of His refusing to hear them. And yet in Matthew 7:7, the Lord said, “Ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find.” How do we explain this seeming contradiction? The two verses are describing two types of people, and the Lord warns that He will not answer those who call on Him but do not have the fear of the Lord.</p><h1>There is a good English proverb - “He who neglects the occasion, the occasion will neglect him.”</h1><p>Here is a warning that as even a child of God, when we choose not to walk in the fear of the Lord, we will live a life of destruction. Basically, we just wasted our life on this earth!</p>
