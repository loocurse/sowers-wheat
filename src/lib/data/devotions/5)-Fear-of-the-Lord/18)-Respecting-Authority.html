<h1>Devotion 18 – Respecting the Authority in the Fear of the Lord</h1><p>1 Pet.2:13-17 – “Therefore submit yourselves to <strong>every ordinance of man</strong> <strong>for the Lord’s sake</strong>, whether to the king as supreme, or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good. <sup> </sup><strong>For this is the will of God</strong>, that by <strong>doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men— <sup> </sup>as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bondservants of God</strong>. Honour all people. Love the brotherhood. <strong>Fear God. Honour the king.”</strong></p><p>Christians were horribly targeted for persecution during the reign of Nero. He ordered that Christians should be rounded up and killed. Some were torn apart by dogs, while others were burnt alive as human torches. Even then, Paul exhorted the Romans Christian to submit to the abusive Government.</p><h1>Rom.13:1-6 – “Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore, whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves… Do you want to be unafraid of the authority?...<sup>  </sup>For he is God’s minister to you for good…Therefore <em>you</em> must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience’ sake. <sup> </sup>For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God’s ministers attending continually to this very thing.”</h1><h1>Both these scriptures state very clearly that non-submission by Christians to authority is certainly sin, and deeply displeasing to God. We may be setting ourselves in opposition to God even while we think we’re honouring Him. Both Peter and Paul declared that there is a sovereign God in heaven who ordains all things. To fail to submit is to oppose the sovereign God.</h1><p>So, whether it’s about our complaints when paying taxes or refusing to pay respect, or denying the power of the civil government or mocking government officials, the fact is that we probably have some repenting to do.</p><h1>The call to obey the civil government here is premised on the clause, “for the Lord’s sake.” </h1><p>In other words, we don’t submit because it is advantageous to us. We don’t submit because the government is doing the right thing. We don’t submit because everything is as what we want it to be. No, we submit because it is pleasing to our Lord.  Our submission to the civil government is actually submission to Him and His sovereign rule over all things.</p><p>Peter said, “For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.” Notice that “doing good” is held in parallel with the first call to “be subject.” That means that when we submit ourselves, and obey and give honour to those whom God has appointed over us, we are both “doing good” and bringing glory to God.</p><p>Submission does not only mean a physical submission, but it includes an attitude of submission as well. If we say that we submit, but keep grumbling and criticising, that’s not submission. We are to render honour where honour is due. If we submit and grumble at the same time, it is not biblical submission. We are to submit with our flesh and our attitude.</p><h1>We are not to “speak evil of a ruler of your people” (Acts 23:5; Ex.22:28)</h1><p>Our “freedom”, then, is the freedom to serve God, not to serve ourselves. That’s why Peter said we aren’t supposed to use our new freedom in Christ “as a cover-up for evil.” Our freedom in Christ can’t be an excuse to set ourselves above the authorities God has set in place. Our freedom in Christ can’t be an excuse to deny their power or mock them. To do so would be an act of rebellion against our sovereign God. To do so would be to say that God has made a mistake and we know better than He.</p><p>Please don’t misunderstand. We’re not talking about embracing every law passed or policy made. Laws that support LGBT and protecting abortion are absolutely abhorrent to God. We’re not talking about turning a blind eye to sin. There are times and places for civil disobedience. Peter himself chose at times to disobey the human authorities because they were in direct contradiction to what God commands.</p><h1>Acts 4:17-18 – “So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. <sup> </sup>But Peter and John answered and said to them, “Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than to God, you judge.”</h1><h1>Acts 5:28-29 – “Did we not strictly command you not to teach in this name? And look, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this Man’s blood on us!”</h1><p>But Peter and the <em>other</em> apostles answered and said: “<strong>We ought to obey God rather than men.”</strong></p><p>The call here is to obey in all things that are not contrary to God’s law and to honour those whom God has set in authority over us. And it is perfectly permissible for the Christian to work toward greater justice and love for life; to work to change laws and policies so that they fall in line with what God says is right and good and true. </p><p>Jesus, during his time on earth, submitted himself not only to God but also to the civil authorities. He submitted to them and stood silent against their accusations</p><h1>1 Pet.2:21-23 – “For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:<sup> </sup>“Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth”;<sup> </sup>who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed <em>Himself</em> to Him who judges righteously…”</h1><p>And through His submission to God that subsequently led to His death, He ransomed us from sin and brought us into His marvellous light. We should all learn from His example and entrust ourselves fully to God by submitting to the governing authority. </p><h1>1 Sam.15:23 – “For rebellion <em>is as</em> the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness <em>is as</em> iniquity and idolatry.</h1><h1>Rebellion against God-given authority is serious sin. Satan fell because he wanted to usurp the authority of God. That has been his appeal to all fallen human beings ever since. All defiance against God-given authority originates from Satan and puts those who resist authority in opposition to God Himself.</h1>
