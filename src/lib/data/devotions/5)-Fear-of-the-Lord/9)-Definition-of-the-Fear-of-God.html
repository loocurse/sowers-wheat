<h1><strong>Devotion 9 - Definition of the Fear of the Lord</strong></h1><h1>As mentioned in the previous devotion, we are living in spiritual perilous days! </h1><p>Due to our hardness of heart and fearing man more than God, we have softened the fear of the Lord into mere respect or reverence. However, if we were to examine the Scriptures carefully to see how “the fear of the Lord” is used and in what context it’s used, it always depicts this idea of complete and utter obedience to the Lord and living right within His kingdom. In fact, many a times, the exhortation regarding the fear of the Lord makes reference to His final judgment.</p><h1>Ecc.12:12-14 – “And further, my son, be admonished by these…Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep His commandments, for this is man’s all.<sup> </sup>For God will bring every work into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.”</h1><p>Even in the final book of Revelation, an angel exhorted with a loud voice, “<strong>Fear God</strong> and give him glory, because <strong>the hour of</strong> <strong>his judgment has come</strong>. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water” (Rev.14:7).</p><p>The “fear” (Hebrew <em>yireh</em>) of the Lord means - to be afraid, terrified, or in awe (the aspect of overwhelming admiration). There is no justification for understanding “the fear of the Lord” as mere respect or reverence. </p><h1>Heb.12:28 – “Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom which cannot be shaken, let us have grace, by which we may<sup> </sup>serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear. <sup> </sup>For our God <em>is</em> a consuming fire.”</h1><h1>“Reverence and godly fear” – if the fear of God were limited to just reverence, God would not need to separate the two concepts. More than just reverence, we need to realize that there is also an aspect of healthy respect for His righteous judgment. God is still holy and thus, he will discipline and judge our sinful behaviour. Yes, God is full of grace, compassion, mercy and love. However, He is also holy, just and righteous. His love is unconditional, but that does not equal to no boundaries or limitation! God never intends to “spoil” us with His love!</h1><h1>Paul’s Consciousness of the Judgement seat of Christ</h1><p>2 Cor. 5:9-11 – “Therefore <strong>we make it</strong> <strong>our aim</strong>, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. For <strong>we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ</strong>, that each one may receive the things <em>done</em> in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. Knowing, therefore, <strong>the terror of the Lord, </strong>we <strong>persuade men</strong>; but we are well known to God, and I also trust is well known in your consciences.”</p><h1>Notice here Paul says: “we make it” – he assumes personal responsibility. And “our aim” speaking of his mindset, his chief goal in mind, what drives his planning and purpose, etc. because he was conscious that one day, “we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ”.</h1><h1>And with the same mindset and knowing the “the terror of the Lord”, he continues to “persuade men”.  In other words, because of his consciousness of the impending judgement of God, the focus of his ministry is not just to preach the salvation message, but rather to warn believers to continue walking in a manner pleasing to God.</h1><p>God is to be feared—not just respected—even by a Christian who trusts in Jesus Christ. The unbeliever should fear God because they are sinners and God is righteous, believers should continue to fear God to keep them from sin.</p><h1>Goodness &amp; Severity</h1><h1>Rom.11:22 – “Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in <em>His </em>goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off.”</h1><p>But we must appreciate both the “<em>kindness and severity of God</em>”. If we just focus on His goodness and love without considering His holiness, it makes us a worldly &amp; spoilt Christian. On the hand, fear without understanding His grace, mercy, compassion and love makes us rigid and legalistic. However, understanding this tension keeps us on the narrow path with a walk that is pleasing and worthy of Him.</p><h1>Work out our salvation with fear &amp; trembling.</h1><h1>Phil.2:12 – “Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling”.</h1><h1>Jer.5:21-22 - “Listen, you foolish and senseless people - who have eyes but do not see, who have ears but do not hear. Do you not fear Me? Why do you not tremble in my presence?” </h1><h1>We work out our salvation by actively pursuing obedience in the process of sanctification.  Paul elaborated this further in the next chapter of Philippians by describing himself as “straining” and “pressing on” toward the goal of Christlikeness (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Phil%203.13-14" target="_blank">Phil.3:13-14</a>). Like a physical workout, we work out not to get a body, but to develop the body you already have. Similarly, we work out, not to earn salvation, but to develop the salvation we already own. </h1><h1>Col.1:29 – “To this <em>end</em> I also labour, striving according to His working which works in me mightily.”</h1><p>Jn.15:4-7 – “Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me.<strong><sup> </sup></strong>“I am the vine, you <em>are</em> the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. <strong>If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw <em>them</em> into the fire, and they are burned.</strong> <strong><sup> </sup></strong>If you abide in Me, and <strong>My words abide in you</strong>, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you”</p><h1>If we put all these scriptures together, it means that we are to work out our salvation by His grace – by abiding in Him, walking in obedience to His word and with His Spirit consistently. In other words, it is to practice the “presence of God” is our lives and let our entire lives be a worship unto Him.</h1><h1>“Trembling” refers to a healthy fear of offending God through disobedience, and an awe and respect for His majesty and holiness. It can also refer to a shaking due to weakness, one which brings us to a state of dependency on God. Thus, we work out our salvation by going to the very source of our salvation, by abiding in His Word and Spirit with reverence and awe of His holiness!</h1>
