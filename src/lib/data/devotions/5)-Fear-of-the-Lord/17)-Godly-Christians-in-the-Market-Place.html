<h1>Devotion 17 – Godly Christian in the Market Place</h1><h1>1 Pet.1:15-17 – “He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, <sup> </sup>because it is written, “Be holy, for I am holy.”<sup> </sup>And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear…”</h1><p>The fear of God is supposed to stimulate us to holy living. Peter reminds us that God is a responsible Father and judges impartially, that He has no favourite children whom He will allow to get away with disobedience. He is no indulgent father.</p><h1>2 Cor.6:16-18 – “And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you<sup> </sup>are the temple of the living God. As God has said: “I will dwell in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they shall be My people.”<sup> </sup>Therefore “Come out from among them and be separate, says the Lord. Do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you.” “I will be a Father to you, and you shall be My sons and daughters, Says the Lord Almighty.”</h1><h1>2 Cor.7:1 – “Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”</h1><p>It is good and necessary that we learn to claim and appropriate the promises of God. But it is equally important to <strong>recognize God’s claim on our lives and walk in it</strong>. We are therefore to treat our body as the temple of the Holy Spirit and cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit. </p><p>We who truly recognise our bodies are the temple of God will consciously and intentionally want to perfect our bodies in holiness.  Having the fear of the Lord in our hearts gives us the hatred for sin &amp; the strength to depart from it.</p><h1>Prov.16:6 – “In mercy and truth atonement is provided for iniquity; and by the fear of the Lord one departs from evil.”</h1><h1>Prov.8:13 – “The fear of the Lord <em>is</em> to hate evil…”</h1><h1>Godly Person in the Market place</h1><h1>Col.3:22-25 – “Bondservants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh, not with eye service, as men-pleasers, but in sincerity of heart, fearing God. And whatever you do, do it heartily, as to the Lord and not to men, <sup> </sup>knowing that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance; for<sup> </sup>you serve the Lord Christ. <sup> </sup>But he who does wrong will be repaid for what he has done, and there is no partiality.</h1><h1>1 Tim.6:1 – “Let as many bondservants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed.”</h1><p>The principles underlying the master-slave relationship apply in today’s employer – employee situations (including owners, managers, supervisors, etc.)</p><h1>Submission to authority is a structure God has ordained as an expression of our fear of the lord. We are to work in our jobs or professions as though working for the Lord. We must always remember that God is our ultimate boss and we’re to serve Him with reverence.</h1><h1>1 Pet.2:18-20 – “Servants, be submissive to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the harsh. For this is commendable, if because of conscience toward God one endures grief, suffering wrongfully.”</h1><h1>Our submission should not hinge on their manner but “because of our conscience toward God” which means our consciousness towards God’s all-seeing eye and our desire to please Him. When we can recognize Christ as our Master, and our work as rendered to Him, it should make us faithful servants, whoever may be our immediate employer.</h1><p>Col.4:1 - Masters, give your bondservants what is just and fair, <strong>knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.”</strong></p><h1>Lev.25:42-43 – “The people of Israel are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, so they must never be sold as slaves. <sup> </sup>Show your fear of God by not treating them harshly.”</h1><p>This should be the attitude of Christian employers or those in authority today – treating employees fairly because of their fear of the Lord. If we are conscious of this truth, we will treat those who are under us with dignity and respect.</p>
