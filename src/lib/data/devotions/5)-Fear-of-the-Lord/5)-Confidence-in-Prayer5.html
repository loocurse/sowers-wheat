<h1><strong>Devotion 5 - Confidence in our prayers</strong></h1><h1>Prayer is one of the most important things a Christian can do. It is the vehicle for daily dialogue with the One who created us. It is so important that it was mentioned over 250 times in the Scriptures and it should be taken very seriously.</h1><h1>Ps.145:17-18 – “The Lord <em>is</em> righteous in all his ways, gracious in all his works.<br />The Lord <em>is</em> near to all who call upon Him, to all who call upon him in truth.”</h1><p>Yet many people feel that their prayers are not heard by God. They pray and pray but it seems that God is not listening and thus, not answering their prayers.  However, the bible clearly tells us that God is near to those who call upon Him in truth. Hence, He hears us if we are sincere in our prayers.</p><p>However, if we still live a sinful lifestyle and are not ready to obey Him, or if we still want to walk in our own ways and refuse to heed His teachings, then our prayers will probably not be heard by God.</p><p><em>Isa.59:1-3</em> – Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; nor his ear heavy, that it cannot hear. But <strong>your iniquities have separated you from your God; and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he will not hear.</strong> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue has muttered perversity…”<em> </em></p><p>Here Isaiah rebuked the Israelite nation – though they have made sacrifices and prayed to God, their prayers were not heard by God. From these verses we learn that even if we call upon the Lord in truth but still persist in a life of sins, our prayers will not be heard. We have to depart from sin and live a life of righteousness according to the word of God.</p><h1>Our confidence of God listening to our prayers is in the fear of the Lord.</h1><h1>Acts 10:1-4 – “There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian Regiment,<sup> </sup>a devout <em>man</em> and one who feared God with all his household, who gave alms generously to the people, and prayed to God always. <sup> </sup>About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming in and saying to him, “Cornelius!” And when he observed him, he was afraid, and said, “What is it, lord?” So he said to him, “Your prayers and your alms have come up for a memorial before God.</h1><p>The Bible tells us that Cornelius was a man who feared God and prayed to God even before he knew Jesus.<strong> </strong>He was mentioned again in Acts 10 where he was described as a man who feared God and those who served in his household described him as a just man. </p><h1>Acts 10:22 – “And they said, “Cornelius <em>the</em> centurion, a just man, one who fears God and has a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was divinely instructed by a holy angel to summon you to his house, and to hear words from you.”</h1><p>So, in our lives, if we want our prayers to be heard by God, we too must fear God. It was also promised in Psalm 145:19 that<strong> </strong>“He will fulfil the desire of those who fear Him; he also will hear their cry and save them.</p><h1>In the book of Hebrews, it even says that Jesus’ prayers were heard because of His fear towards the father. </h1><h1>Heb. 5:7 – “who, in the days of His flesh, when he had offered up prayers and supplications, with vehement cries and tears to him who was able to save him from death, and was heard because of his godly fear…”</h1><p>We are who we are because of the grace of God and we draw the grace of God upon our lives through our prayer life. Our life and ministry cannot be bigger than our prayer life! If we want to be effective and fruitful for the Lord, we need to learn to walk in fear of Him.</p><h3>A Book of Remembrance</h3><h1>Mal.3:16 – “Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened and heard them; so a book of remembrance was written before him. For those who fear the Lord and who meditate on His name.</h1><p>This is a metaphorical expression and the expression is to convey that God takes special notice and gives special honour to those who fear Him and who encourages each other in the fear of the Lord. </p><h1>Prayer of those who do not fear God</h1><h1>Prov.28:9 – “One who turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination.”</h1><h1>The word “law” in original language means “instruction”. Hence, God is saying that if one turns away his ear from His instruction in the Sacred Scriptures, even his prayer is an abomination to Him.</h1><h1>A heart that fears God give our prayers wings to fly them to the throne of God.</h1><h1>Ps.147:11 - “The Lord takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope in His mercy.”</h1>
