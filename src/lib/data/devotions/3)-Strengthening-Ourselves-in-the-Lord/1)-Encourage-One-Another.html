<h1><strong><em>Devotion 1: Encourage One Another</em></strong></h1><p>I once read a very thought-provoking book written by an American psychiatrist M Scott Peck entitled ‘The Road less travelled.’ On the first paragraph of the first chapter, was written - “Life is Difficult. This is a great truth, one of the greatest truths.”</p><p>Well, I think we can all agree and resonate with that. Life is full of trials, struggles, temptation, pain and disappointment, etc. Human existence is accompanied by the basic fact that there will be problems in life. In fact, the Scripture tells us plainly:</p><h1>Job 5:7 – “Man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward”</h1><h1><a id="_Hlk518015"></a>Acts 14:22 - “We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.”</h1><p>We are living in a difficult world, we get setbacks and discouragements. For that reason, God exhort us to intentionally encourage each other as frequently as possible.</p><h1>Heb. 10:24-25 – “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but <strong><em>encouraging one another</em></strong>—and all the more as you see the Day approaching.”</h1><h1>Heb.3:13 - “Encourage one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be <strong><em>hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.”</em></strong></h1><p>We are called to encourage one another because otherwise, we’ll be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness. Discouragement can open the door for temptation and sin to deceive us. And encouragement from one another is something that the Holy Spirit uses to build up the people of God and to keep them steadfast and faithful. In fact, the earlier verses exhort us to encourage one another daily, which means that it should be part of our everyday activity as we fellowship with one another.</p><h1>In 1 Thess. 2:11–12 Paul summarized his dealings with the Thessalonian Christians this way: </h1><p>“For you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children, <strong>encouraging</strong>, comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory.”</p><h1>In Acts 16:40, we see Paul and Silas in encouraging the believers in Philippi. </h1><p><strong><sup>“</sup></strong>After Paul and Silas came out of the prison, they went to Lydia’s house, where they met with the brothers and sisters and <strong>encouraged them</strong>. Then they left.”</p><h1>Again, in Acts 20:1-2 when he wrote about the aftermath of the riot in Ephesus, </h1><p>"When the uproar had ended, Paul sent for the disciples and, after <strong>encouraging them</strong>, <br />said good-by and set out for Macedonia. He travelled through that area, speaking <strong>many words of encouragement</strong> to the people, and finally arrived in Greece" </p><p>Paul, when he couldn't visit some Christians as he wished, sent. other Christian leaders to encourage them. In 1 Thessalonians 3:2 he wrote, </p><p>"We sent Timothy, who is our brother and God's fellow worker in spreading the gospel of Christ, <strong>to strengthen and</strong> <strong>encourage</strong> you in your faith." </p><p>Constantly, many of us battle with sin and we forget what Jesus has done for us.  We all  need to be <a href="https://www.beforethecross.com/encouragements/following-jesus-one-day-at-a-time/">reminded about Jesus over and over again</a>, for once we remember Jesus, our perspective immediately gets realigned with His perspective.</p><p>John 16:33 – “These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”</p><p>Jesus says that in the world, we will have trials and tribulation. Things are going to get discouraging, hopeless and challenging at times, but He said to take heart, He has overcome the world!</p><p>To “take heart” also means to take courage and be confident. We can be confident in the One who has overcome this world and who has saved us. Jesus has already won! </p><p>For that reason, we need to constantly encourage one another to trust and believe that Jesus has overcame the world for us and that He now lives in us. Thus, nothing in the world, no matter how evil it is, can ever overcome us, and we can have peace in Him.  We need to constantly remind each other about the victory we have in Christ</p><h1>1 Thess.5:11 – “Therefore <strong>encourage one another</strong> and build each other up, just as in fact you are doing.”</h1><h1>1 Thess. 5:14 - “And we urge you, brothers and sisters, warn those who are idle and disruptive, <strong>encourage the disheartened,</strong> help the weak, be patient with everyone.”</h1><p>We all need encouragement to fight a good fight and to finish the race well. Make that phone call. Send that text. Meet up in person. Do whatever you need to do to be an encouragement to others to strengthen them and help bring the light of Jesus into darkness.</p>
