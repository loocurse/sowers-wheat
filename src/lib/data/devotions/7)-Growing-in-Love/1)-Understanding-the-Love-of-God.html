<h1>Devotion 1- Understanding the Love of God</h1><p>Our finite human mind can never fully comprehend and define an infinite God. If God is incomprehensible, then so is His love, for God is Love. If we can never fully fathom it, how can we precisely define it?</p><p>However, let’s try to examine the full counsel of God in the Scriptures to have a glimpse of His divine love so that we may all learn and grow.</p><h1>Jn.17:20-25 - <sup> </sup>“I do not pray for these alone, but also for those who will believe in Me through their word; <sup> </sup>that they all may be one, as You, Father, <em>are</em> in Me, and I in You; that they also <strong><em>may be one in Us</em></strong>, that the world may believe that You sent Me. <sup> </sup><strong><em>And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one</em></strong>: <sup> </sup>I in them, and You in Me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me, and have loved them as You have loved Me. <sup>  </sup>“Father, I desire that they also whom You gave Me may be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me; for You loved Me before the foundation of the world. <sup> </sup>O righteous Father! The world has not known You, but I have known You; and these have known that You sent Me.”</h1><p>In this important prayer which Jesus prayed just before Calvary, He prayed that the glory that He had with the Father would be given to us, and that we may be one as He and the Father are one.</p><p>The Scripture clearly says that we are to be “made perfect in one”. However, this oneness will come because the glory that Jesus had is given to us. Note, it is the glory from God which makes us one and not our oneness that brings the glory.  What is this glory that will make us one with the Trinity?</p><h1>Ex.33:17-19 – “So the Lord said to Moses, “I will also do this thing that you have spoken; for you have found grace in My sight, and I know you by name.”<sup> </sup>And he said, “Please, <strong><em>show me Your glory.</em></strong>”<sup> </sup>Then He said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before you. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.”</h1><h1>Ex.34:6 – “And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth…”</h1><p>In the Old Testament, when Moses asked to see God’s glory, God revealed His goodness, graciousness, mercy, kindness and compassion which in essence are all the qualities and elements of God’s divine love. The Shekinah (God’s dwelling) glory which was so mysterious under the Old Covenant is unveiled for us in the New Covenant as the great love of God. All the sacrifices and shadow types of the Old Testament were fulfilled in Christ who gave Himself in love for us.</p><h1>1 Jn.4:8 – “He who does not love does not know God, for <strong><em>God is love</em></strong>.”</h1><h1>1 Jn.4:16 – “And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. <strong><em>God is love</em></strong>, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him.”</h1><h1>Jn.1:14 – “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we <strong><em>beheld His glory</em></strong>, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.”</h1><p>It is obvious from all these Scriptures and many more, that the glory of God and the love of God are two sides of the same coin! They are the very substance from the person and presence of God. </p><p>So, when we say the whole earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord (Hab.2:14), it can also understand as the whole earth shall be filled with God’s Love.</p><p>Love is the foundation of the nature and character of God.  It is the basis of everything that God has revealed to mankind in the Holy Scriptures.  He is a being of infinite love; His character is the very personification of love. Thus, to truly know love, we must know God. And to know God is to know love. God and love are one!</p><p>Since the glory of God and the love of God are one and the same, to grow in love is to grow in the glory of the Lord! The more love we have, the more glory we demonstrate. The more we grow in love, the more we are growing into oneness to manifest His glory. There is no way we can minister in the glory<s> </s>of God without releasing love. When we minister in love, we are ministering in His Glory!</p>
