<h1>Devotion 2- Perfected in Love</h1><h1>1 Jn.4:18 – “There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been <strong><em>made perfect in love</em></strong>.”</h1><h1>What does it mean to be ‘perfect in love’?</h1><p>It means that we are exactly like Him in glory and nature. When we are perfected in love, our heart beats to the heartbeat of God, our mind flows with the mind of Christ, and our souls resonate with the compassion of Christ. There is no more fear as we are perfectly one in Him. It is not our love but the love or glory of the God that transforms us. </p><h1>2 Cor.3:18 – “But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image <strong><em>from glory to glory</em></strong>, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.”</h1><h1>Jn.1:16 – “And of His fullness we have all received, and <strong>grace for grace</strong>.”</h1><p>Love and glory can only be received in proportion to the transformation of our inner soul. We should learn to minister and walk only in the degree of light and love that we have received. We can overstrain our physical muscles with too much exercise, if we do it beyond our physical means. Likewise, it is also possible to overstrain our spiritual and soul muscles through walking beyond our faith and love levels. For that reason, many in their zeal to serve suffer burnout in the ministry. <a id="_Hlk34864848"></a></p><p>Understanding that we grow in love and glory by stages, we should not feel too discouraged if we find ourselves not walking perfectly in love all the time. Be patient with ourselves and others as God is patient with us and others. We grow from grace upon grace and glory to glory!</p><h1>Where do we begin in this walk of perfect love? </h1><p>We begin by loving others, including our enemies, like Jesus did. Then we will be perfect in mercy like our Heavenly Father is perfect. </p><h1>Matt.5:48 – “Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.”</h1><h1>Christians who are not willing to grow and walk in love are mere believers, not disciples. </h1><h1>Jn.13:34-35 – “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are <strong><em>My disciples, if you have love for one another.”</em></strong></h1><p>There are many believers but not many disciples. The only mark of being a disciple of Christ is love. The one and only mark that Jesus said will differentiate His Disciples from those who merely believe in Him is the mark of love. If we don’t take time to grow in love, we have missed the most important part of this life. Growing in love and growing in the glory of God are most fundamental in our lives.</p><p>We will always give time to what we deem the most important in our lives. Understand that Jesus left us one great commandment, and that is the commandment to love one another as He loved. We must schedule time to cultivate that into our lives.</p><h1><em>We are made by Love, Through Love &amp; for Love</em></h1><h1>Col.1:16 – “For by <strong><em>Him</em></strong> all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through <strong><em>Him </em></strong>and for<strong><em> Him</em></strong>.”</h1><p>In this scripture, the word “Him” clearly refers to Christ. Christ is the personification of Love. Therefore, we can also interpret this scripture as stating that we are made by love, through love and for love. Hence, until and unless we are fully filled with love, we can never reach our highest potential.</p><h4>S.O.S 2:4; 6:4 – “He brought me to the banqueting house, and <strong>his banner over me was love</strong> …<strong><sup>”</sup></strong></h4><p>In ancient times, when a King spreads and displays his banner (flag) over a fortress, he is declaring his determination to protect that place. As that flag waves in the breeze, it signifies that all the power and resources of the king are pledged to defend and safeguard that fortress. And this is what Jesus means when the Bible says that ‘His banner of love over the believing soul’. All the resources of The Omnipotent--all the perfections of an infinite God are enlisted for the safety of that soul.</p><p>When the Israelites fought the Amalekites at Rephidim, Moses held up his hand, symbolizing God's presence to help His people win the victory (Ex.17:8-16). After the battle, Moses built an altar and called it "Jehovah-nissi" (The Lord Is My Banner). </p><h1>S.O.S 6:4 – “O my love, you <em>are as</em> beautiful as Tirzah, Lovely as Jerusalem, awesome as <strong>an army with banners</strong>!”</h1><h1>S.O.S 6:10 – “Who is she who looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun,<br /><strong><em>awesome as an army with banners?”</em></strong></h1><p>In S.O.S 6:4;10, the Bride is compared with an army with banners. Three thousand years ago, Solomon saw and prophesied about such a bride, an army willing to fight and die for the gospel of love. However, we need to receive and fully rest under that banner of His Love over us before we can mature to be an army of banner for Him! </p><h1> </h1><p>May the eternal and unconditional love of God our Father and of our Lord Jesus Christ be our daily experience.</p>
