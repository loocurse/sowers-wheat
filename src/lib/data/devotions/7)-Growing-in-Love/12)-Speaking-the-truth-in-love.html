<h1><strong>Devotion 12 – Speaking the Truth in Love </strong> </p><p>       	</h1><p>Eph.4:15 – “<strong><em>Speaking the truth in love</em></strong>, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head – Christ<sup> </sup>from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, <strong><em>causes growth of the body</em></strong> for the edifying of itself in love.”</p><p>Generally, this verse is often used to remind us of the need to share difficult truths in a gentle, kind, and inoffensive manner. And if rebuke is necessary, it should be done with tenderness, humility and sensitivity, never with arrogance and harshness. However, if we observe the context carefully, it gives us deeper insight on what it means to “speak the truth in love.”</p><h1><em>Truth That Builds Up</em></h1><p>In the verses prior to this command, Paul writes about unity in the <a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/body-of-Christ.html">body of Christ</a> and he urges us to “live a life worthy of the calling we have received” (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%204.1" target="_blank">Eph.4:1</a>).</p><p>Later, He talks about Christ giving to the church apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers “to equip his people for works of service, so that the body of Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God and become mature, attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of Christ” (<a href="https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Eph%204.12%E2%80%9313" target="_blank">Eph.4:11–13</a>).</p><p>Paul’s instruction in this whole chapter centers around doctrinal issues and is directly applicable to the growth and edification of fellow believers (vs.16). Thus, the issue he is addressing is the adherence to true doctrine, so that we will not be deceived by false doctrine. Hence, it is in this context of church unity and spiritual maturity that Paul exhorts us to speak the truth in love.</p><p>Thus, our call to speak the truth in love is gospel oriented. We are to speak the truth, which is in contrast to the falsehood of deceptive teachings, unscriptural world view and worldly philosophies; and we are to do so in love for the purpose of building up the body of Christ.</p><p>We should always speak God’s Word of Truth to each other even those parts that bring, rebuke, correction and discomfort, etc. However, our motivation to do so must be characterized in love and not pride.</p><h1>2 Tim.3:16-17 – “All Scripture <em>is</em> given by inspiration of God, and <em>is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness</em>, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work.”</h1><p>As followers of Christ, we are to uphold the truth of God’s revealed Word. That means there will be times when we must confront error as we contend for the faith. With unbelievers, this will often take the form of apologetics, boldly giving a defense for the hope that is in us. “and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear…” (1Pet.3:15). With fellow believers, this may take the form of confrontation, as we plead with a spiritual brother or sister to repent of sinful thinking or action.</p><p>Biblical love “does not rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth” (<a href="http://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Cor.%2013.6" target="_blank">1 Cor. 13:6</a>). Our postmodern world wrongly equates love with tolerance of all beliefs and actions. But being tolerant of doctrinal error or unrepentant sin is not truly loving at all. Love and truth go hand in hand. If we truly love, we will want to build one another up in the truth. At times, speaking the truth can be the most loving thing we can do. </p><p>Thus, when the Bible commands us to correct, reproof or rebuke one another using scripture, it is regarded as a great act of love, with the kind intention to stop us from continuing on a destructive path. </p><p>In fact, the book of Proverbs, which is one the wisdom Books of Hebrew Scripture, regards correction and rebuke as a gift of gold as it comes with astounding blessing for those who embrace it. </p><h1>Prov.25:12 – “Like an earring of gold and an ornament of fine gold is a wise rebuker to an obedient ear.”</h1><h1>Prov.10:17 – “He who keeps instruction is in the way of life, but he who refuses correction goes astray.”</h1><h1>Prov.12:1 – “Whoever loves instruction loves knowledge, but he who hates correction is stupid.</h1><h1>Prov.13:18 – “Poverty and shame will come to him who disdains correction,<br />But he who regards a rebuke will be honoured.”</h1><h1>Prov.15:5 – “A fool despises his father’s instruction, but he who receives correction is prudent.</h1><h1>Prov.15:31-32 – “The ear that hears the rebukes of life will abide among the wise.<br />He who disdains instruction despises his own soul, but he who heeds rebuke gets understanding.”</h1><p>The truth can be painful to hear at times, but it will bear good fruit in the life of one who hears and responds with a humble spirit. It is important to note that “speaking the truth in love” is different from “loving to speak the truth”. The former is motivated by love while the latter could be motivated by self-righteousness. Everybody wants to be loved and therefore correction must be accompanied with compassion rather than an attitude of superiority. We all need to learn the skill of love. It is not merely about “what” to correct; but “how” to correct. </p>
