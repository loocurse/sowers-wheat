<h1>Devotion 14 - God’s Love in Discipline</h1><p>The constancy of God’s love does not mean that we should not expect adversity. On the contrary, the author of Hebrews assures us that discipline in fact is a proof of His love.</p><h1>Heb.12:5-11 – “My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him; <em>for whom the Lord loves He chastens</em>, and scourges every son whom He receives.<sup> </sup>If you endure chastening, God deals with you as with sons; for what son is there whom a father does not chasten? <sup> </sup>But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, <em>then you are illegitimate and not sons</em>. <sup> </sup>Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? For they indeed for a few days chastened us as it seemed best to them, but He <em>for our profit</em>, that we may be <em>partakers of His holiness</em>. <sup>11 </sup>Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable <em>fruit of righteousness</em> to those who have been trained by it.”</h1><p>There is both a restful side and a wrestling side to the Christian life. To be an overcomer, we must understand what Scripture teaches about God’s loving discipline. If we take a reflective observation of our life experiences, we will probably notice that most of the precious lessons learned that enriched and enhanced our lives, were gained through affliction rather than good times. Yet, most of us struggle to understand how God can be both good and omnipotent, and yet allow suffering. We have forgotten that God has called us to “run with endurance the race that is set before us” (Heb.12:1) and to learn to respond to God’s loving discipline and grow in holiness through it. This race will have suffering because suffering will refine us and help us grow. </p><p>God has given us wonderful promises in His Word, that though He disciplines us, His steadfast love will not depart from us.</p><p>2 Sam.7:14-15 - “I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. When he commits iniquity, <strong><em>I will discipline him </em></strong>with the rod of men, with the stripes of the sons of men, <strong><em>but my steadfast love will not depart from him.</em></strong>” </p><p>True faith comes from complete abandonment to His Divine Providence and Sovereignty. Let us consider some reasons why we should learn to submit to His loving discipline.</p><ol><li><em>It is an essential aspect of the Father-son Relationship (Heb.12:7-8)</em></li></ol><p>Discipline is a mark of genuine sonship. The Scripture states clearly that if we lack discipline, we are not a true child of God, but rather illegitimate and an illegitimate child has no inheritance. If we are His true child, then trials are evidence of His love, not His neglect or rejection,</p><h1>Prov.3:11-12 - “My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor detest His correction; For whom the Lord loves He corrects, just as a father the son <em>in whom</em> he delights.”</h1><ol><li><em>That we may yield the peaceful fruit of righteousness and share in His Holiness (Heb.12:9-11)</em></li></ol><p>Our heavenly Father knows each of us thoroughly and perfectly, including all our thoughts and motives. Thus, He knows exactly how to ‘fine tune’ us, so that we can grow to conform into the likeness of Christ and be partakers of His holiness. </p><p>Sometimes we are unaware of our sins or shortcoming until God brings some trial that exposes them. As the Psalmist testified, “Before I was afflicted, I went astray, but now I keep Your Word” (Ps.119:67). There was no indication that he was rebellious before he was afflicted. It could be that the affliction made him aware of his hidden sins. The discipline of the Lord is a protective force in our lives that is often intended to preserve our lives.</p><p>True faith is submitting to His sovereign right over us and trusting that He will administer it perfectly for our highest good and to prepare us for His eternal purpose. If we resist and harden our hearts, we will miss the purpose of the discipline. If we keep in mind what God is doing in the light of eternity, then we can endure the discipline with inner joy and peace which will ultimately bear the peaceful fruit of righteousness.</p><p>Job 5:17-18 - “Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore, despise not the discipline of the Almighty. For He wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal.</p><p>God is always at work in our adversities. He never allows any adversity in our lives that is not ultimately for our good. Though we may not always see or discern what specific spiritual good a particular adversity can bring, God is transforming us to become what is pleasing to him. </p><p>None of the ingredients in the cake tastes good by itself. However, after they are skilfully mixed in the right proportions and then baked in the oven, they taste good. Likewise, all the adversity in life by itself is not good for us, but God skilfully mixes it together for our good. (Rom.8:28)</p><p>Will we accept the mystery of God’s providence in the pain of our life, and be trained by it for the sake of good, peace, holiness, righteousness and life? Or will we demand in the season of suffering that God gives a greater account of Himself?</p><h1><em>Mother Heart of God</em></h1><p>Isa.49:14-15 – “But Zion said, “the Lord has forsaken me” To which the Lord responded forcefully. “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she borne? Though she may forget, I will not forget you”</p><p>God uses a picture of nursing baby at his mother’s breast to illustrate His love.  To the world, this is the picture of the greatest love.  Yet mothers are sinful and sometimes their natural love can be overcome by their own selfish interest. The greatest human love may sometime fail, yet God’s love never fails. Israel, even in the depth of its sin, was not cut off from God’s love. God disciplined the nation severely, but He did not cease to love Israel. Never take our eyes away from God’s love! </p>
