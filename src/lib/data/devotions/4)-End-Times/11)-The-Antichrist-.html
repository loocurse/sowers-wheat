<h1><strong>Devotion 11 - The Antichrist </strong></h1><h1>1 Jn. 4:3 – “Every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is <em>the spirit of the Antichrist</em>, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world”</h1><p>The next event on the end-time calendar is the rise of the Antichrist. However, we must always be alert to the spirit of Antichrist, which is already in the world to charm and induce our hearts away from Christ through the spirit of pleasure, humanism, materialism, etc. </p><p>And though sin and lawlessness are already at work today through the spirit of Antichrist, Paul warned of a day in future when a specific individual will come into power during the tribulation period who will be the embodiment of sin and lawlessness. He is known as the man of sin or the Antichrist and will bring immense suffering to humanity in the end-time. </p><h1>2 Thess.2:3-4 – “Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and <em>the man of sin</em> is revealed, the <em>son of perdition</em>, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that <em>he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God</em>.”</h1><p>The Antichrist will arise before Jesus Christ returns. He is the devil incarnate, a real person and not just a system or an institution.  ‘Son of perdition’ means <em>destruction</em>, the complete loss of well-being. It is really the opposite of <em>salvation</em>. To call him the son of perdition means he will bring many into destruction. In the end-times, he will exalt himself above everything and everyone and proclaim himself to be God. </p><h1>Dan.11:36-37 - “Then the king shall do according to his own will: <em>he shall exalt and magnify himself above every god</em>, shall speak blasphemies against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the wrath has been accomplished; for what has been determined shall be done.<sup> </sup>He shall regard neither the God of his fathers nor the desire of women, nor regard any god; for <em>he shall exalt himself above them all</em>.”</h1><h1>Hence, the Antichrist is not only a political ruler but also a man with a false religion. He will not only deceive the nations of the earth, but he will deceive all the religions of the earth.  He will rise in the future and will establish a kingdom and a religion that is worldwide. </h1><h1> <em>The Peace Covenant</em></h1><h1>Dan.9:27 – “Then he shall confirm a covenant with many for <em>one week; but in the middle of the week He shall bring an end to sacrifice and offering</em>. And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, even until the consummation, which is determined, is poured out on the desolate.”</h1><p>This scripture brings us to the last week of Daniel. It will begin when the Antichrist makes a peace covenant with Israel. However, in the middle of the 7-year period, he will break the covenant and desecrate the Temple. </p><p>That is what Jesus meant when He said, "When you see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place...[then don't wait; get out of Jerusalem as fast as you can] for there will be a time of trouble such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never shall be." (Matt.24:15-21).</p><h1><em>His Mark – 666</em></h1><h1>Rev.13:16-18 – “He causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark <em>on their right hand or on their foreheads</em>, <sup> </sup>and that <em>no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast</em>, or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: <em>His number is 666</em>.”</h1><p>It is imperative to know that receiving the mark of the beast is apparently an unpardonable sin. The decision is irreversible. Receiving the mark signifies approval of the Antichrist and his purpose. The choice will be deliberate, that is those who choose the mark will do so with the full knowledge of what they are doing. One consciously chooses either to stand for or against the Antichrist.</p><p>This knowledge is vitally important as many Christians are afraid and anxious that they may unconsciously take on the mark through deception or the use of modern technology.  They claimed that the mark will be a high-tech chip inserted under the skin, a barcode on the hand or the forehead, etc.</p><p>Notice that the Bible says that the mark will be on the people and not in them. It will be on the right hand or head and will be a visible sign to identify whether they are for or against the Antichrist.  The mark serves as a commerce passport. Only those who have the mark will be permitted to work, buy, sell or simply make a living, and hence the mark will have life and death consequences, economic wise. Thus, in the end-times, one has to choose to either receive the mark and live or reject the mark and face suffering and death. </p><p>However, those who choose to receive the mark will eventually face the consequences of God’s wrath and eternal suffering.</p><h1>Rev.14:9-11 – “Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and <em>receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand</em>, <sup> </sup>he himself shall also <em>drink of the wine of the wrath of God</em>, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. <sup> </sup>And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.”</h1><h1><em>Our Responsibilities </em></h1><p>The Spirit of Antichrist is already in the world - “the mystery of lawlessness is already at work” (2Thess.2:7). The idea is that everything that the Antichrist represents is present in our time till he finally comes in full position and power.</p><p>The word ‘Antichrist’ also means ‘instead of’ or ‘in the place of’ Christ. It means he is against Christ or is opposed to Christ and is going to say the exact opposite of everything that Jesus Christ says. He is the polar opposite of Christ and his goal is to replace and usurp the position of Christ in every heart. His objective is not just to deceive the nations but most importantly, to deceive the believers. In fact, Jesus warned <strong><sup>“</sup></strong>false Christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect…” (Matt.24:24).</p><p>Thus, we ought to be watching and praying, and be aware of the spirit of Antichrist. We are not just scanning the horizon for the Antichrist to come in the future but watch for it today so that as the Bride, we will not be deceived, distracted; but instead to always be ready for the True Christ!</p>
