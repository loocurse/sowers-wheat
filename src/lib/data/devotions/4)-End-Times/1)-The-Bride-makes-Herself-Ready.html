<h1><strong>Devotion 1 – The Bride makes Herself Ready</strong></h1><p>So much has been said about the Second Coming and the Signs of the Times—but what information can we really trust?  I think we should not be focusing on when the event will take place but rather, how we are living in preparation for the glorious and long-awaited day, with joy and anticipation. Instead of trying to predict the exact date of His Coming, we merely have to live ready for His Coming.   The church is likened to the bride of Christ.  As a bride, how can we be ready?</p><h1>Rev.1:4 – “John, to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne…”</h1><h1>Rev.1:8 -<sup> </sup>“I am the Alpha and the Omega, <em>the</em> Beginning and <em>the</em> End,” says the Lord, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty.”</h1><p>God is eternal, He is the Alpha and the Omega, He precedes all things and He will bring all things to conclusion and fulfilment. He sovereignly controls and guides the destiny of men and nations. He is the origin and end of history. He has the first word in creation and the last word in the new creation. However, most Christian are only conscious of the Jesus who was and the Jesus who is, but few are conscious and earnestly awaiting for the Jesus who is to come.</p><h1><em>Jesus who was – The Historical Jesus </em></h1><h1>Rev.1:5-6 – “Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To Him who loved us and <em>washed us from our sins in His own blood </em>and has made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be<em> </em>glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.”</h1><h1>This is the Jesus whom we know through the Holy Scripture. Through His life on earth, He revealed to us God’s nature and character, and His Father heart for us, His children. Most importantly, the historical Jesus reminds us of what He has done for us, that is, cleansing us from our sins by His precious blood. Through Him we can now come to our Father God without hindrance.</h1><h1><em>Jesus who is – The Present Jesus</em></h1><h1>Rom.8:34 – “Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the <em>right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us.”</em></h1><p>The physical presence of Jesus, the resurrected Christ, is now seated at the right hand of God, interceding for us. However, being omnipresent, Jesus is also with us here, in the heart of each believer, guiding us, strengthening us and empowering us with His grace that we may all fulfil our destiny in Him. </p><h1><em>Jesus who is to come – The Futuristic Jesus</em></h1><h1>Rev.19:7 – <sup>“</sup>Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and <em>His bride has made herself ready.<sup>”</sup></em></h1><p>The ‘historical Jesus’ came about 2,000 years ago—to pay a dowry, as it were, with his own blood. And he is coming soon to marry us (His Church). The marriage of the Lamb (Jesus) is one of the greatest events prophesied in the Bible and the next greatest event the Church is looking forward. </p><h1><em>Big Misconception </em></h1><p>In this passage, we, as the betrothed wife – the Bride - has made herself ready. Notice that it is the bride who makes herself ready. Many Christians think that as believers, we will all automatically become the bride of Christ, when Jesus the bridegroom comes. Sadly, the bible says that the bride must make herself ready on this earth to be married.</p><p>Be ready. Get prepared. Many Christians know that Christ is coming to receive them as His beloved bride; but unfortunately, few are prepared for it.  We have allowed our hearts to be weighted down with the things of this world. Throughout the New Testament, we are exhorted again and again to “Watch and Pray” lest we be caught unprepared for the glorious coming of our beloved bridegroom.</p>
