<h1>Devotion 3 – How to make ourselves Ready?</h1><h1>There are three kinds of righteousness mentioned in the Scripture:</h1><h1><em>Human Righteousness </em></h1><h1><em>Isa.64:6 – “We are all like an unclean thing, and all our righteousness are like filthy rags…”</em></h1><h1>When it comes to our justification, our “good” can never be good enough for the perfectly holy and completely righteous God to earn our own salvation. As Isaiah points out, our righteousness is about as good as ‘filthy rags’. In Hebrew it literally means, “like as rags of menstruation.” The point is, both our acts of righteousness, and the quality of righteousness that we hope can get us saved, are disgusting to God. Indeed, the gospel is good news because we are saved not by what we have done, but by what Christ has done. We can never be saved by our own good works of righteousness!</h1><h1><em>Imputed righteousness </em></h1><h1>When we believe in Jesus, we are made righteous in Christ through faith. His righteousness is imputed to us. We are made righteous with His righteousness. </h1><h1>Isa.61:10 – “I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God; For He has clothed me with the <em>garments of salvation</em>, He has covered me with <em>the robe of righteousness…</em>”</h1><h1>Rom.4:20-24 – “He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform. <sup> </sup>And therefore ‘it was accounted to him for righteousness<em>.’<sup> </sup>Now it was not written for his sake alone</em> <em>that it was imputed to him,<sup> </sup>but also for us. It shall be imputed to us who believe in Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead…”</em></h1><h1>Every born-again Christian has the imputed righteousness of Christ, it is the righteousness that is credited to us based on our spiritual rebirth and this righteousness restores our identity as a child of God. In a sense, we can consider it as ‘passive’ righteousness, that is, we simply receive it from God by His grace for the forgiveness of sin through faith.</h1><h1>Eph.2:8-9 – “For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; <em>it is</em> the gift of God,<sup> </sup>not of works, lest anyone should boast.”</h1><h1><em>Walk of righteousness. </em></h1><p>However, after receiving the robe of righteousness for our salvation, we are also commanded to walk in ‘active’ righteousness as God-given responsibilities, crucifying the flesh and walking in the spirit. In other words, salvation by grace alone through faith does not take away man's responsibilities to walk in righteousness. </p><h1>1 Tim.6:11 – “But you, O man of God, flee these things <em>and pursue righteousness</em>, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness.</h1><h1>1 Jn.3:10 – “In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: <em>Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God</em>, nor is he who does not love his brother.”</h1><h1>Rom.6:13 – “And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God… <em>present your members as slaves of righteousness</em> for holiness.”</h1><p>It is a grave mistake for Christian to settle for the imputed righteousness of Christ and to fail to seek after the practical righteousness of God. </p><h1><em>Getting ourselves Ready for the Bride</em></h1><h1>Rev.19:7-8 – “Let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory! For the wedding of the Lamb has come, and <em>his bride has made herself ready</em>.<sup> </sup>And to her it was granted to be arrayed in <em>fine linen, clean and bright</em>, for the fine linen is the <em>righteous acts of the saints.”</em></h1><h1>The fine linen, clean and bright with which the bride makes herself ready for the bridegroom is not referring to the garment of ‘imputed or passive righteousness’ but rather to the garment of ‘active righteousness – they are ‘the righteous acts of the saints”. This means that the bride has made herself ready by her ‘active walk’ of righteousness. </h1><h1> </h1><p>To get ourselves ready as the bride, we must translate our imputed righteousness into outworking of practical righteousness. It is confusing when people say that the only righteousness that has any value is the imputed righteousness, apart from that, all righteousness are ‘filthy rags’ before God. Is God pleased only with Christ’s work, and always displeased and disgusted with ours? </p><p>Not at all. Time and time again, the Scriptures show that God is pleased with the righteous deeds of the saints. Indeed, the entire “Hall of Faith” in Hebrews 11 is a catalogue of the great deeds of the saints. Think of all that was done by Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Rahab, Gideon, Samson, David, Samuel, and others. Are all their deeds “filthy rags” in God’s sight? Thus, we should be praying always that we are continuously filled with the fruit of righteousness to glorify God in and through our lives. So that as a bride, we are always ready!</p><h1>Phil.1:9-11 – “And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ, <em>being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.”</em></h1>
