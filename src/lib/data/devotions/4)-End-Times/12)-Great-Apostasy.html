<h1><em>Devotion 12 – Apostasy in the End Times</em></h1><h1><a id="_Hlk17902783"></a>Matt.24:32-33 - “Now learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer <em>is</em> near.<sup> </sup>So, you also, when you <em>see all these things, know that it is near—at the doors</em>!”</h1><p>Throughout the Scriptures, we are exhorted to be thoughtful observers of the times and seasons. Thought we are never to set dates, for no one will know the specific day or hour of Jesus’ coming, but we are expected to know the general season by virtue of the signs of the times. We are to be aware of what Scripture teaches about biblical prophecy, and at the same time keep a close watch on events unfolding in the world, so that we can identify any possible correlation between the two.  For that reason, we are always called to watch and pray!</p><p>God has obviously revealed certain things through biblical prophecy, and we are supposed to observe those signs so that when biblical prophecies are fulfilled, or the stage is being set, we will be ready. Apart from the signs of natural disaster (Matt.24:3-8) and moral decay, (2Tim.3:1-5; Matt.24:12) one of the warning signs to look out for and to be on guard against, apostasy. </p><h1><em>The Great Apostasy </em></h1><h1>1Tim.4:1-2 – “Now <em>the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith</em>, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons, speaking lies in hypocrisy, having their own conscience seared with a hot iron…”</h1><h1>2Thess.2:3 – “Let no one deceive you by any means; for <em>that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, </em>and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition…”</h1><p>In these two Scriptures, we are also clearly warned of the danger of apostasy in the end times. But let us examine deeper into the definition of apostasy through the scripture.</p><p>Heb.10:26-29 - “Dear friends, if we <em>deliberately continue sinning</em> after we have received a full knowledge of the truth, <em>there is no other sacrifice that will cover these sins</em>. <em>There will be nothing to look forward to but the terrible expectation of God’s judgment </em>and the raging fire that will consume his enemies. Anyone who refused to obey the Law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or more witnesses. Think how much more terrible the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God and have treated the blood of the covenant as if it were common and unholy. Such people have insulted and enraged the Holy Spirit who brings God’s mercy to his people”. (NLT)</p><p>Apostasy is not the same as spiritual backsliding.  Backsliding is where a Christian fall into sin due to a momentary weakness in the flesh.  A true believer may at times wander away from the Lord, get trapped in the pursuit of worldly pleasures, stop attending Church or Christian fellowship and even reach the point where he is no longer recognized as a Christian. But should he repent, God’s forgiveness is never too far to reach him, and he can be restored to fellowship again.  That means that anyone who fears that they have fallen so far from Christ that they no longer have hope of restoration and redemption, is not an apostate.  </p><p>An apostate is one who is devoid of such godly fear, for his heart is so hardened that he had actually brought himself to renounce Christ and walk in unrighteousness. Therefore, people who regard their salvation carelessly face a real danger of drifting into such a state.</p><h2><em>The Peril of an Apostate</em></h2><p>“For it is impossible for those who were <strong><em>once enlightened</em></strong>, and have <strong><em>tasted the heavenly gift</em></strong>, and have <strong><em>become partakers of the Holy Spirit</em></strong>, and have tasted the good word of God and the <strong><em>powers of the age to come</em></strong>, if they fall away, to renew them again to repentance, since they <strong><em>crucify again for themselves the Son of God</em></strong>, and put Him to an open shame. For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God, but if it bears thorns and briers, it is rejected and near to being cursed, whose end is to be burned” (Heb. 6:4-8)</p><p>This is one of the most solemn warnings about the kind of sentence awaiting an apostate, for it is impossible to restore them again to repentance.  What could these people have done to disqualify themselves from renewal and restoration?  </p><p>Firstly, the Bible says they were once enlightened.  That means they had once believed and understood the gospel, but later returned to the darkness of sin and hardened their hearts against God.  Then, they have also tasted the heavenly gift and were once partakers of the Holy Spirit, which means they have participated in the ministry of God with the Holy Spirit, working with Him and being witness of His glorious power.  They have also witnessed the power of the word of God and the powers of the age to come, for they have seen signs, wonders and miracles which all attest to the power of God.  Thus, by returning to their sinful ways and living in rebellion against God’s word, their sins are crucifying Christ all over again on their own account.  </p><p>The story of the earth and the rain further illustrates this.  The ‘rain that often comes upon (the earth)’ is the grace of God that is given freely on everyone who calls on Him.  Though all believers receive this grace, in the same way how all the earth receives the falling rain, yet not all believers bear fruits of righteousness, which is similar to how not all the land will produce herbs useful for mankind.  The believers who use the grace of God to work out their salvation diligently are like the land that bears herbs – both will be blessed by God.  But the believers who received His grace in vain and bore fruits of unrighteousness are like the land that bore thorns and briers.  Both will be rejected by God and destined for destruction.</p><p>Judas Iscariot’s betrayal of Jesus for 30 pieces of silver is a classic example of apostasy and its effects (Matt.26:14-25, 47-57; 27:3-10)</p><p>Hymenaeus and Alexander experienced a shipwreck of their faith and Paul had to ex-communicate them from the church as they apparently even engaged in blasphemy (1Tim.1:19-20).</p><h1>Demas turned away from the apostle Paul because of his love for the present world (2Tim.4:10).</h1><p>1Pet.4:7 – “But the end of all things is at hand; therefore, be serious and watchful in your prayers”.</p><p>There are sobering times ahead and Peter connected the urgency of prayer with the drawing near of the end of the age. We should seriously ‘watch and pray’ to get ourselves ready to be the bride of Christ.</p>
