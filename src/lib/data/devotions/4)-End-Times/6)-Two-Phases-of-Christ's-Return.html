<h1>Devotion 6 – Understanding the Two Phases of Christ’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Coming</h1><p>The End Times can be more easily understood when a distinction is made between the coming of Christ in the heavens for the rapture of the Church, and the coming of Christ to the earth for the nation of Israel and to reinstate His kingdom. In other words, there are the two phases to Christ’s second coming.  </p><p>Let me try to explain why we believe the second coming of Christ will happen over two phases. There are Bible references which distinguish the Gentile dispensation from the Jewish dispensation. The Jerusalem Council in Acts 15 met to consider the question of the Gentile and concluded that God (in the church age) was visiting the Gentiles to choose from among them  a people for His Name sake, and would one day return to “restore the tabernacle of David” (implying the Jewish kingdom) (Acts.15:14-16). Paul spoke of the rejection of the Jews and the salvation of the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. (Rom.9:24-28; 11:15-25).</p><p>Thus, Israel and the Church are two distinct entities, with distinct characteristics, identities, and destinies.  Israel is a nation; while the Church is made up of people from different nations (including Israel) who have put their faith in Christ.</p><p>In the beginning, when God sent the Lord Jesus to save the world (His first coming), it was also meant to be accomplished over two phases.  Though God intended to save the whole world, the salvation of God was first for the Jews, then for the Gentiles. </p><h1>Rom.1:16 – “For I am not ashamed of <em>the gospel of Christ</em>, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, <em>for the Jew first and also for the Greek</em>.”</h1><p>Thus, for 4000 years, God reserved revelation and manifestation of Himself only for the Jews, His chosen race.  The divine plan was for Israel to bring God’s glory to the rest of the world, as salvation was meant for the whole world. It is only in the last 2000yrs that God turned His attention to the Church (comprising Gentiles &amp; Jews, and termed “One New Man in Christ”). </p><h1>Eph. 2:14-15 – “For He Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, <sup> </sup>having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself <em>one new man</em> from the two, thus making peace…”</h1><p>Christ has come to break down the wall (which is the Law) that separates the Jews from the Gentiles and create a ‘One New Man’ – which is the church. However, from the gospel, we can see that when Christ first came to the earth, His ministry majored in gathering the lost sheep of Israel (Phase 1).  </p><h1>Matt.15:21-28 – “Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed. But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, send her away, for she cries out after us. <sup> </sup>But He answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Then she came and worshiped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!” But He answered and said, <em>“It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs</em>. <sup> </sup>And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their masters’ table. <sup> </sup>Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire. And her daughter was healed from that very hour.”</h1><p>When Jesus sent out His twelves disciples to preach the gospel, He forbade them from going to the Gentiles, but only to the house of Israel.</p><h1>Matt.10:5-8 – <sup>“</sup>These twelve Jesus sent out and commanded them, saying: <em>“Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter a city of the Samaritans.<sup> </sup>But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel</em>. <sup> </sup>And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ <sup> </sup>Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give.</h1><p>It was only after His death on the cross, His subsequent resurrection, and the command He gave to His disciples, to “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations…” (Matt 28:19), that the ministry of bringing salvation to the Gentiles started (Phase 2).  </p><p>We could say that Jesus had two phrases in His first coming: with His first three years primarily for the Jews; and post resurrection, His ministry was to the entire world. This would mean that there was a separation of about three years in the two phrases of first coming.</p><p>Therefore, is it possible that His second coming is also in two phrases, now to the church first than to the Jews?</p>
