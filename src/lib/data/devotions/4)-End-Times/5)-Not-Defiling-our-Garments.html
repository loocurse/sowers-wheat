<h1>Devotion 5 - Not Defiling our Garments of Righteousness </h1><h1>Rev.3:4-5 – “You have a few names even in Sardis who <em>have not defiled their garments</em>; and they shall <em>walk with Me in white, for they are worthy</em>.<sup> </sup>He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, <em>and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life</em>; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.</h1><h1>Before coming to faith, our own ‘garments of righteousness’ are like ‘filthy rags’ (Isa.64:6). Having trusted in Christ, we are clothed with the garment of salvation and the robe of righteousness (Isa.61:10). However, the bible clearly warns that we can defile our garments when we choose to walk in sin.</h1><h1>The fact that the bible says “few…have not defiled their garments…” imply that many have defiled the garment of righteousness given to them. And the warning “I will not blot out” also implies that the person’s name is already there in the Book of Life, and he needs to be an overcomer for his name to remain there.  However, if one turned to worldliness and stays there, he will suffer eternal damnation, because when Jesus Christ comes again, “anyone not found written in the Book of life was cast into the lake of fire” (Rev.20:15)</h1><h1>We are exhorted to walk worthy of Him, which means to walk in righteousness. This parallels the truth in Rev.19:7-8 – “His bride has made herself ready.<sup> </sup>And to her it was granted to be arrayed in fine linen, clean and bright, for the fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.”</h1><p>Through His cross He makes us worthy to come to the Father, but after that, we must take up the cross daily to make ourselves worthy of Him!</p><h1>Matt.10:38 – “And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me.”</h1><h1><em>Cleans ourselves </em></h1><h1>1 Jn.3:2-3 – “Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. And <em>everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself</em>, just as He is pure.”</h1><p>There are things that God cleanse for us (like sin) but there are things God expect us to work with the Holy Spirit to purifies ourselves (our unclean words, works and our unclean lifestyle). The bible puts the responsibility on us to have the motivation and the determination to keep ourselves pure.  There is a definite sense that we must be active in the process of purification from sin.  </p><h1>2 Cor.7:1 – “Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us <em>cleanse ourselves</em> from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</h1><h1>Jas.4:8 – “Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. <em>Cleanse your hands</em>, you sinners; <em>purify your hearts</em>, <em>you</em> double-minded.</h1><p>One day we’re going to see Him—not as He was, but as He is, in all His majesty, all His power, all His glory. Understanding biblical prophecy will purify us from sin. True hope of Christ’s second coming is a purifying hope, it should motivate us to grow in holiness now. Sadly, we sin because we enjoy sinning. We don’t consider the long-term consequences. We need to be awakened to the reality that Jesus is coming soon so that it motivates us to keep our ways pure before Him. </p><h1>Worldliness make us enemies of God. And enemy cannot be his bride. Jesus doesn’t come to marry His enemy. Jesus comes to marry a bride who makes herself ready, not one who is still flirting with the world.</h1><h1>Jas.4:4 – <sup>“</sup>Adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? <em>Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.”</em></h1><h1>In other words, the condition of the Church determines the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ. For that reason, Peter exhorts us to be responsible in hastening His coming. </h1><h1>2 Pet. 3:11-12 - “Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner <em>of persons</em> ought you to be in <em>holy conduct and godliness</em>, looking for and <em>hastening the coming of the day of God</em>, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?”</h1><h1><em>Restore the first commandment to the top priority in our lives.</em></h1><h1>Rev.2:2-5 - “I know your works, your labour, your patience, and that you cannot<sup> </sup>bear those who are evil. And you have tested those who say they are apostles and are not and have found them liars; and you have <em>persevered and have patience and have laboured for My name’s sake and have not become weary</em>. Nevertheless, I have <em>this</em> against you, that you have <em>left your first love</em>. <sup> </sup>Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent and do the <em>first works,</em> or else I will come to you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place—unless you repent.</h1><p>Our faithfulness, perseverance, patience, discernment and steadfastness are good and necessary attribute we need to cultivate as we walk with the Lord, but they are not enough. The greatest commandment (loving the Lord our God with all our heart, with all our soul and with all our mind) needs to be the greatest passion and pursue in our lives if we want to be ready for the bridegroom. </p><p>Jesus the bridegroom wants to come back to receive a bride that is truly in love with Him, and not one who wants to marry Him because she wants a good life in heaven. </p><p>Would anyone marry someone who is still very much in love with his or her ex-boyfriend or girlfriend?</p>
