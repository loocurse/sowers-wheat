<h1>Devotion 9 - Parable of the Loving Father</h1><p>In Lk.15:11- 32, we have a story in the Bible which is commonly referred to as the Parable of the Prodigal son. However, we would prefer to refer it as ‘The Parable of the Loving Father’.</p><p>In this parable, we have the contrast of two sons who lived with their loving father. Sadly, one thought he did not need the father, while the other thought he did not have a father. The first was rebellious and the other was devout, but neither of them understood their loving father’s heart.</p><h1><em>The Rebellious Son</em></h1><p>At home, the younger son thought he was missing out on the fun of life. Like many Christians, they think that if they pursue a life of holiness and authentic discipleship, they will miss out too much of what the world can offer. Thus, he decided to ask for his inheritance so that he can enjoy his life. Inheritance is usually given at the father’s initiative nearing his death, and thus, by his action, the younger son was actually saying he wished for the death of his own father. In effect, he is saying, ‘Give me what is mine because I want to live outside your will’ - he was declaring independence from his father. </p><h1>According to Mosaic law, he would have deserved death. </h1><p>Deut. 21:18-21 - “If a man has a stubborn and <strong><em>rebellious son</em></strong> who will not obey the voice of his father or the voice of his mother, and <em>who,</em> when they have chastened him, will not heed them, then his father and his mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his city, to the gate of his city. And they shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey our voice; he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ Then all the men of his city <strong><em>shall stone him to death with stones</em></strong>; so, you shall put away the evil from among you, and all Israel shall hear and fear.”</p><p>Fortunately for him, he had a different kind of father, a loving, gracious, merciful and compassionate father who complied to his request, knowing well that the irresponsible son would squander it away.</p><p>The son was selfish and only interested in himself. He was never concerned that his father’s pain of missing him &amp; worrying about him. Even when he returned home, it was not for the sake of his father, but for his own survival. He never saw the yeaning &amp; loving heart of his father.</p><p>Like him, most Christian cannot see that God desires us &amp; rejoices over us. After all, He created and owns everything. He could create anything to bring Him pleasure, He could self-entertain endlessly. However, the bible tells us that He longs for each one of us personally, as a friend, son and even a lover. </p><h1>Jn.4:23 – “But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for <em>the Father is seeking such to worship Him</em>.”</h1><h1>God is seeking for a true lover among His children.</h1><h1><em>God is also a Jealous Husband </em></h1><h1>Jas.4:5 – “Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, “The Spirit who dwells in us <em>yearns jealously</em>?”</h1><p>“Yearns” – Is to long for intensely just like how a romantic couple would long for one another when they are away from each other or how one would long for their loved ones when they pass away. It is an intense yearning to the extent he warns us that, “whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world make himself an enemy of God” (Jas.4:4)</p><p>He is passionate about His relationship with us. He is not passive in His love for us, He loves us jealously. </p><h1>Ex.34:14 – “for you shall worship no other god, for the Lord, <em>whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God”</em></h1><h1>Not only is jealousy one of God's attributes, it is also His name. </h1><p>The word Jealousy usually comes with a negative connotation. It is often associated with coveting, envy, resentful and a hateful spirit towards someone who has something we want or something we don't have.  And the Bible condemns this type of negative jealousy as a sin. </p><h1>Gal.5:26 – “Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, <em>or be jealous of one another</em>.” (NLT)</h1><h1>1 Pet.2:1 – “So get rid of all evil behaviour. Be done with all deceit, hypocrisy, <em>jealousy</em>, and all unkind speech.” (NLT)</h1><p>How can our jealousy be bad, and God's jealousy be good? How can our jealousy be a sin and God’s jealousy be holy?</p><h1><em>Human Jealousy vs God’s Jealousy</em></h1><p>Human jealousy is often driven by envy or “the desire to gain possession of something that doesn't belong to us”.  However, God’s jealousy is driven by His zeal, “His desire to possess and protect that which is rightfully His.” </p><p>As a husband, if we know that someone is making advances towards our wife, we will try our best to protect and preserve our marriage jealously. Our jealousy is motivated by the zeal to protect and preserve the one who belongs to us. If we don't become jealous, what kind of a message would that send to our wife? It is as good as telling her we either don't love her or we don't love her enough to fight for her and to preserve our relationship.  Well, just as we husbands don't want to share our wives with someone else, God doesn’t want to share us with someone or something else. He is the One who created us. We belong to Him. </p><p>As believers, we have entered a “covenant relationship” with GOD, which means in a very real way we are “married to God”.  We see this “marriage” relationship exemplified in the New Testament between Christ, the husband and His bride, the Church, which is us.  When GOD sees someone or something trying to come between Him and us, His righteous jealousy is aroused, because we belong to Him and He is zealous to protect and preserve His relationship with us. </p><p>God’s jealousy towards us proves how much He truly loves us. It pains Him deeply to see His people worshiping gods that cannot love them, care for them, help them, hear them, see them, or do anything for them. </p><p>We should often examine our heart - is there anyone or anything that has come between us and God?  If there is, we will need to decide today what we are going to do about it.  </p><h1>Our God Is A Jealous God! He loves us so much that He is jealous over us.</h1><p>The parable is not primarily about a son who lost his inheritance but about the pain of a loving father who lost his son. Understanding the love of God has a profound effect on our identity in Christ. Many of us are not secure in our identity in Christ because we are not secure in God’s love. </p>
