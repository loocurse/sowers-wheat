<h1>Devotion 5 – New Creations</h1><p>Through our union with Adam, we are all born sinners and thus, we behave like serial sinners, sinning every day in thought, word, deed and motive.  The good news of the gospel is that through our union in Christ, we are justified become children of God. However, truth be told, many of God’s children still struggle as serial sinners daily. How do we live in our new identity and have victory over sin?</p><h1><em>A New Heart &amp; A New Spirit</em></h1><p>Eze.36:26-27 “I will give you <strong><em>a new heart</em></strong> and put <strong><em>a new spirit</em></strong> within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>I will put My Spirit within you and <strong><em>cause you to walk in My statutes</em></strong>, <strong><em>and you will keep My judgments and do them</em></strong>.”</p><p>This promise was given to us some 600 years before the death of Christ. And God has promised to radically change our hearts and put His Holy Spirit within us to enable us to obey Him. For that reason, Paul says “if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come (2 Cor.5:17). That means our old identity in Adam is gone forever, and is no longer true of us. We now have a new identity in Christ. We have a brand-new relationship with God the Father through Christ.</p><h1><em>New Identity, New Life</em></h1><p>In Adam, we were under both the guilt of sin and the dominion of sin. But now, through our union with Christ, we have died to both the guilt of sin and its dominion over us. We are now able to obey God and please God. Our old Identity in Adam is gone, together with its bondage to the reign of sin.</p><p>Our new identity in Christ now defines who we are. Through our union with Christ, the basic disposition of our heart has been changed. God has taken away our stony hearts and given us hearts that are spiritually alive and responsive to Him.</p><h1>Rom.6:11 – “Likewise you also, <em>reckon</em> yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. Therefore, do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts.”</h1><h1>To ‘reckon’ is to think carefully, especially regarding our action. We should not let sin continue to reign in us; but instead, our new identity is to reign in us. We must be constantly conscious of this truth and to let it affect our daily decisions, behaviour and actions. We are now the branches on the vine (which is Christ), and thus partake of the spiritual and vitality that is in Him.</h1><h1><em>Guerrilla Warfare</em></h1><h1>Gal.5:17 – “For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish.”</h1><h1>Unfortunately, though we have been delivered from the absolute bondage to sin, we have not been totally freed from its influence. We are now still in spiritual guerrilla warfare, and how we glorify God depends on how we engage this warfare.</h1><p>We have an enemy that does not stop opposing us. Through we are freed from sin’s dominion, sin still desires to destroy us. So, we must always be vigilant against its assaults and put to death the expressions of sin in our bodies and minds through the power of the Holy Spirit within us. Only in eternity can we be absolutely free from sin. For now, we just have to live out our new identity and fight the warfare daily.</p><h1><em>Grace, Grace, Grace</em></h1><p>Regrettably, many of us do not live out our identity in Christ. From the scripture, we learn that the flesh continues to strive against the Spirit, and unfortunately, many lose this battle daily, especially for those struggling with persistent sin.  What shall we do then?  Do not feel ashamed, exhausted and lose patience.  Instead, we should take our sin to the cross and remember the Grace of God through our union with Christ.  Maintain the attitude of repentance and contrition, knowing and believing that there is no sin that is beyond the cleansing power of the blood of Christ. </p><p>We cannot have power to resist sin if we have not first dealt with its guilt. And the only way to do this is to continually go back to the cross and see Jesus bearing that sin and paying its penalty through His death. </p><p>Often, it seems that the old person in Adam is still very much alive, but that is not our true identity. It is the flesh striving against the Spirit. Our true identity is in Christ. Through the grace of God in our lives, we can all grow and progress in becoming the new creations in our daily experiences as well as in our identity.</p><h1><em>Taking our lives Seriously with God</em></h1><h1>2 Cor.13:5 – “Examine yourselves as to whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you? - unless indeed you are disqualified.”</h1><p>We are called to examine our faith and test ourselves. Here are some questions to help examine our walk with God:</p><ul><li>What is our attitude toward sin? Are we concerned or indifferent about it?</li><li>What is our attitude toward God? Are we dependent on Him and acknowledge our accountability to Him?</li><li>What is our attitude toward the Scripture? Are we intentionally growing in our understanding and application of it in our life?</li></ul><p>The important question is. “Do we have evidence of our identity in Christ?”. We might still struggle with sin and even experience frequent failures, but can we truthfully say that we are heading towards the right direction? Privilege always comes with responsibility! With the privilege of our new identity in Christ, we are responsible to not let sin continue to reign in our thought and behaviour. </p>
