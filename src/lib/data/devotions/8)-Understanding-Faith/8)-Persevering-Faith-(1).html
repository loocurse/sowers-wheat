<h1>Devotion 8 – Persevering Faith (1) – Pilgrim Mindset</h1><p>Heb.11:36-40 – “Still others had trial of mocking and scourging, yes, and of chains and imprisonment. <strong><em>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, were tempted, were slain with the sword. They wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, tormented -<sup> </sup>of whom the world was not worthy. They wandered in deserts and mountains, in dens and caves of the earth.</em><sup> </sup></strong>And all these, having obtained a good testimony through faith, <strong><em>did not receive the promise</em></strong>, God having provided something better for us, that they should not be made perfect apart from us.”</p><p>The main theme in Hebrews chapter11 is faith and it highlights many great Old Testament heroes of faith and how their hope is being rewarded in this life.  Through their example, many of us are inspired to pursue victorious faith or overcoming faith, the ability to conquer and change our life circumstances. Having faith which triumphs over demons, sicknesses and even death is hailed as the victories of militant Christianity. As a result, many often neglect the relevance and value of persevering faith.</p><p>While we acknowledge the heroes of faith who changed things through faith, we need to also recognize that in reality and life, there are some circumstances that are not in our domain or authority to change. And this is not for the lack of faith or a fatalistic mindset, but a different type of faith is needed to overcome such circumstances - not mountain moving faith, but a preserving, enduring and steadfast faith in the sovereign God.</p><p>The above scripture records for us that there were many who were tortured, mocked, scourged, imprisoned, stoned, sawn in two, put to death by sword, who went about destitute, ill-treated, homeless and even died in their faith without receiving their promise.  They died with unfulfilled and unseen promises of God. </p><p>How did these saints get their strength to persevere and remain steadfast in their faith despite the adverse and dire circumstances? In our modern “microwave” society, such perseverance is difficult to practice, but yet we must pursue it mindfully. </p><p>No two lives will be the same as each has their own destiny to fulfil. We must however, choose to bloom where we are planted. Sometimes we have no choice in the circumstances and environment that God has put us in. However, despite whatever circumstances we are in, faith must always be the guiding principle of our life.</p><h1><em>A Pilgrim Mindset</em></h1><p>Heb.11:13-16 – “These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off were assured of them, embraced them and <strong><em>confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth</em></strong>. For those who say such things declare plainly that they seek a homeland. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>And truly if they had called to mind that <em>country</em> from which they had come out, they would have had opportunity to return. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>But now <strong><em>they desire a better, that is, a heavenly country</em></strong><em>.</em> Therefore, <strong><em>God is not ashamed to be called their God</em></strong>, for He has prepared a city for them.”</p><p>A pilgrim mindset is not a popular and dominant model of our times. Today, our emphasis is far too much on the good life here and now. How God can help me to be more prosperous, successful in my career, make me a happier person, overcome my personal problems, etc, etc. The primary focus of our faith is always on what Christ can do for us here and now and heaven seems to be just an extra bonus when we finally leave the earth. For many, heaven is still “a pie in the sky”, we want to enjoy life now and cling to it as long as we are able…we are not mindful that we are mere pilgrims.</p><p>As a matter of fact, the Scripture shows us that rather than settling in and feeling comfortable on earth, these saints felt out of place here. They confessed that they were “strangers and pilgrims on the earth” and desired a better place; they had a pilgrim mindset and realized that not all rewards of faith were necessarily received in this life.</p><p>A pilgrim refers to someone who travels or stays in a foreign place for a while—a sojourner. To ‘make pilgrimage’ is to stay for a short time in a foreign land. In other words, these heroes of faith did not view the Promised Land as their ultimate dwelling place, they were rather, seeking for a better place. To be a ‘pilgrim’ in Christ is to live, walk and work in this world, mindfully knowing that this world is not our home, we are just only passing through - our true home is in heaven.</p><h1>The Scripture reminded us clearly:</h1><h1>Jas 4:14 – “For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.”</h1><h1>Ps.103:15-16 – “The life of mortals is like grass, they flourish like a flower of the field;<sup> </sup>the wind blows over it and it is gone, and its place remembers it no more.”</h1><p>That is how we are to think of ourselves in this world as followers of Jesus!  We need to be consciously aware that our life on this earth is short, but our life in Christ is eternal. We are only pilgrims. Thus, our focus is not just on the rewards on this life, we should have a greater perspective, we look towards a greater reward in our final home. </p><p>Through faith, the saints “embraced” the promises despite adverse circumstances, knowing that since they were the promises of God, they would come to pass in God’s time. This perspective empowered them to remain steadfast and to persevere in their faith!</p><p>For that reason, Peter urges and implore us to be mindful of our ‘pilgrim’ identity…. that we may keep a walk worthy of the Lord, reminding us that there is a “day of visitation”.</p><p>1 Pet.2:11 - “Beloved, <strong><em>I beg you</em></strong> <strong><em>as sojourners and pilgrims</em></strong>, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, <strong><sup> </sup></strong>having your conduct honourable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by <em>your</em> good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation.”</p><p>There is nothing wrong about enjoying God and the blessings He freely bestows on us in this life. But if we do not learn to hold the things of this life loosely, and our goals are not focused on God and being in heaven with Him, we will nurture a very shallow faith and can get distracted and derailed easily. If we just focus on enjoying a good life as a Christian now, we will not be able to thrive in difficult times, endure suffering and persecution, withstand temptations and live an overcoming life.  </p><h1>Ps. 84:5-7 – “Blessed <em>is</em> the man whose strength is in You, <strong><em>whose heart is set on pilgrimage.</em></strong> <sup> </sup>As they pass through the <strong><em>Valley of Baca</em></strong>, they make it a <strong><em>spring</em></strong>; the rain also covers it with pools. They go from <strong><em>strength to strength</em></strong>…”</h1><p>The meaning of ‘Baca’ is weeping, representing a place of tears, of disappointments, of frustrations, of fears and sadness. However, the Scripture says that he whose heart is set on a of pilgrimage will turn it into a place of springs and they will go from strength to strength. </p><h1>Pilgrims do not get attached to the country they are passing through; they have a transient mentality. Thus, the only thing that can empower us with a resilient spirit and steel us with a persevering faith is to live a radical life for Christ – the pilgrim’s life!</h1>
