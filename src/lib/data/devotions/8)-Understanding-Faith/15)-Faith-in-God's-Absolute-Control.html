<h1>Devotion 15 – Faith in God’s Absolute Control</h1><p>There is not a single event that can occur outside of God’s sovereignty. If there is, then we cannot trust Him absolutely. He may permit us to act contrary to His revealed will, but He will never permit us to act contrary to His sovereign will. Below are some Scriptures that validate His sovereignty over our life and circumstances:  </p><h1>Prov.16:9 – “We can make our plans, but the Lord determines our steps.”</h1><p>Prov.19:21 – “There are many plans in a man’s heart, nevertheless the Lord’s counsel - that will stand”</p><h1>Prov.21:30 – “There is no wisdom, or understanding, or counsel against the Lord that will succeed”</h1><p>We often think we can plan for what we want, and decide in our heart how to achieve our desired goals. Making plans is wise and prudent. The Lord designed us with minds to think. He gives us a freewill to make wise choices in life. However, the above verses validate that ultimately, God is the One who directs our path and makes things happen. Unless we are in God’s will, what we think, or plan may not turn out the way we expect. It is God’s way, which is higher than our way, that prevails!</p><p>Paul often made plans to visit churches, and he wrote about the goals he wanted to achieve, but Scripture shows that not all were accomplished, for the Lord was the One who directed his path. On one occasion, Paul's plans to minister in Asia were redirected by the Spirit of God to Macedonia instead (Acts 16:6;9-10). Paul's plans were worthy and worthwhile, but God in His wisdom, ordained them differently.</p><p>Sometimes the plans we make may be good and honourable, but deficient and short-sighted nevertheless, as we have very limited knowledge of the future. Indeed, we have no control over any of our tomorrows. Only God knows the end from the beginning and holds the future in His hands. </p><p>We should always use our sanctified mind, rational thinking and God-given free-will to the best of our ability in our planning; yet, to take comfort that the Lord may direct and overrule our plans in order that we may experience what is best for us. Thus, we should commit every plan we make in prayer and place each desire of our heart into His hands as these plans can succeed only when they are consistent with God’s purpose. No authority on earth or in heaven can make anything happen unless the Lord decrees it. </p><h1><em>No One and Nothing can Frustrate God’s Purposes</em></h1><p>If we ever feel that someone or a certain circumstance is messing up our life, there is absolutely no need for us to worry because no matter what anyone does, he or she cannot abort God’s plans for our life. They may put obstacles in our way to hinder God’s plans but they cannot abort them. When we understand and fully believe that, then nothing would trouble our mind. No person or circumstance can frustrate God’s purpose for our lives. No plan of God can be defeated and frustrated. If it is possible to frustrate God’s plan, that means there is a power more powerful than God.</p><h1>Eccl.7:13 - “Consider the work of God; For who can make straight what He has made crooked?”</h1><p>This is a rhetorical question: Who can make straight what God has intended to be crooked? The answer strongly infers the sovereign God. God Himself makes straight paths and crooked paths and if He has people going down a particular path according to His Will, there is very little we can do about the journey. </p><h1>Job 42:2 – “I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You.”</h1><h1>Isa.14:27 – “The Lord of Heaven’s Armies has spoken - who can change his plans? When his hand is raised, who can stop him?”</h1><h1>Ps.33:10-11 – “The Lord brings the counsel of the nations to nothing; He makes the plans of the peoples of no effect. The counsel of the Lord stands forever, the plans of His heart to all generations.”</h1><p>Human plans will always fail as we cannot take all information into account. However, God’s plan is all-inclusive. It is based on His omniscience, so that everything past, present, and future is considered. God’s omniscience includes all things which will occur, as well as all things which could possibly occur. Every contingency is considered in God’s plan. Even what the devil means for evil, God will work it out for good in our favour. God has everything covered. God’s plan is unchangeable and nothing and no one in this universe can stop that plan. With God, there is no “If only…”</p><h1>Ps.138:8 – “The Lord will work out his plans for my life - for your faithful love, O Lord, endures forever.”</h1><p>David was a man who walked through trouble on a regular basis. His psalms often express the struggles and disappointments he faced, yet in the end, he always turned his focus to, and put his faith in, the absolute sovereignty of God. He had complete trust in the Lord’s character and faithfulness. </p><p>God is concerned over all that concern His children and He has promised to work out His perfect plan in our life. However, sometimes He might choose to complete it in valleys of adversity and hardship, but the trial will last only if He sees fit. Our priority in times of difficulty and pain is to honour and glorify God by keeping our eyes on Him.</p><p>Our God cannot be restricted, He is the maker of all things. Trust Him, have faith in His absolute control and let Him connect the dots in all our life events. He is His only limit!</p>
