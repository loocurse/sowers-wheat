<h1><strong>Devotions 13 – Patience &amp; Faith</strong></h1><p>Heb.6:12 - “You do not become sluggish but imitate those who <strong><em>through faith and patience inherit the promises</em></strong>.”</p><p>Faith and patience must work together to inherit the full promises of God. The world defines patience as the ability or willingness to suppress the irritation in our emotions caused by people or circumstances. However, the Bible shows us that patience (longsuffering, endurance, perseverance) is the fruit of the spirit that gives us the strength to endure and remain steadfast in trusting the promises and character God (Gal.5:22).</p><p>We mistakenly think that patience and faith represent opposite ends of the pole, because we see patience quietly waiting without complaint, while faith would fearlessly and boldly speak things into existence at that very moment. However, the Scripture often links patience and faith together as they go hand in hand. </p><h1>Rev.13:10 - “He who leads into captivity shall go into captivity; he who kills with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the <em>patience and the faith</em> of the saints.”</h1><h1>2 Thess.1:4 - “We ourselves boast of you among the churches of God for your <em>patience and faith</em> in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure…”</h1><h1>Rom.12:12 - “Rejoicing in hope, <em>patient<sup> </sup>in tribulation</em>, <em>continuing steadfastly in prayer…</em>”</h1><p>Patience is not idleness; we should not use patience as an excuse to be lazy. Being patient is a verb, it is about what we do while we wait, it is to have a steadfast and immovable mindset. In the original language, it means to ‘bear up courageously under suffering’. </p><p>We often think that if only we have enough faith, we would see the results immediately. Yet, there is such a thing as a “holding position” of faith until the manifestation comes. One of the words used in the Bible to express patience is “keeping”, it means holding on to and not losing our faith and obedience. When faced with delays, we should be immoveable in our faith, patiently “keeping” ourselves steadfast in prayer, and resting on the faithfulness of God. </p><h1><em>Patience and Steadfastness</em></h1><p>Patience is spiritual steadfastness. It is the ability to withstand assaults, attacks, trials, or any kind of tribulation and persecution. It means strength and resilience to stand in heat, to stand in cold, to stand in trial, to stand in any problems without wavering. It might seem passive in the natural but it is active in the spiritual realm.</p><p>There are two aspects to faith – Drawing and Standing. The first aspect is to reach out to God and draw on His power and grace to manifest in the natural world. Faith is a vehicle that brings the unseen into the seen realm. The second aspect is the power and ability to withstand all contrary forces until the evidence is manifested.</p><p>We must consistently move forward with boldness and courage while, at that same time, patiently wait for change to manifest in the natural. When faith wavers, it is patience that gives strength to empower us to remain standfast. Patience undergirds faith and gives it endurance to persevere until the answer comes. It takes both aspects of spiritual discipline to successfully overcome all setbacks in life. One aspect speaks to the mountains that stand before our path; the other releases the inner forces of Christ within to remain steadfast. Faith it is not just what we believe but how long we can continue to believe despite all opposing circumstances. </p><h1><em>Patience and Hope</em></h1><p>Rom.8:25 - “But if we <strong><em>hope</em></strong> for what we do not yet have, we <strong><em>wait for it patiently</em></strong>.”</p><p>1 Thess.1:3 - “Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labor of love, and <strong><em>patience of hope </em></strong>in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father”</p><p>Faith and patience are completely interrelated rather than existing in isolation.  Biblically, patience is a form of hope.  </p><p>Faith is believing that something will happen, while patience is the steadfastness of waiting until that belief is realized. Faith is the courage to reach out to God for something and then bringing it to manifestation. But patience is the strength to withstand contrary winds, the ability to push away opposition and to conquer it. When faith and patience are working together properly, we will not be discouraged when the answers to our prayers have not yet manifested. We can simply rest in the sovereignty and faithfulness of God to fulfil His promises. Simply put, patience needs faith and faith needs patience. </p><p>Ps.37:7-9 - "Be still in the Lord and <strong><em>wait patiently for him</em></strong>... those who wait for the Lord will inherit the land"</p><p>Heb.10:35-36 - “Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. For <strong><em>you have need of endurance</em></strong>, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise”</p><p>Without patience, we may make many serious mistakes in life and it is here that many battles are lost. Abraham’s impatience resulted in the birth of Ishmael (Gen.13-16) and the Israelites’ impatience led to the golden calf which almost caused the whole nation to be annihilated if not for the intercession of Moses (Exodus 32:10). We need faith to open the door to God’s promises and patience to keep the door open until the promise is fulfilled.</p><p>God sometimes tests our patience through the delays. Faith without patience produces Christians who start off well but who may eventually falter and fall away. On the other hand, patience without faith may produce individuals who go through suffering but yet do not profit from it in the way God intends. Both attributes are equally important for us to be spiritually strong and healthy. </p><h1> “Never sacrifice the permanent on the altar of the immediate.” – Bob Jones </h1>
