<p>Devotion 4 - Faith Does not Guarantee a ‘Good Life’<br /><br />Rom.8:28 - “<strong><em>And we know</em></strong> that in all things God works for the <strong><em>good</em></strong> of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose”.  </p><p>This is perhaps one of the most memorized and quoted verses Christians use to encourage a fellow believer who goes through difficult trials and suffering. This Scripture brings comfort, direction, and hope to Christians every day. Sadly, it is also one of the most misquoted and misunderstood verses in the Bible. </p><p>This verse is not a promise or guarantee of a ‘good life’ if we fulfil the condition of responding in love and faith amid trials and suffering.  If we study the life of Paul, who is the author of the verse, we can see the many things God had allowed him to suffer despite his faith and close relationship with God.  </p><h1>2 Cor.11:23-27 – “Are they ministers of Christ? I speak as a fool - I am more: in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often. <sup> </sup>From the Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one. <sup> </sup>Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in  journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren; <sup> </sup>in weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in fasting often, in cold and nakedness—"</h1><p>David, a man after God’s own heart also went through much suffering despite his faith and close relationship with God. In fact, he was persecuted by Saul for many years and because of that, went through many painful experiences and disappointments. </p><h1>Let us also glean some lessons from Psalm 44.</h1><h1>Psa.44:1-8 – “We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, the deeds You did in their days, in days of old: <sup> </sup>You drove out the nations with Your hand…<sup> </sup>For they did not gain possession of the land by their own sword, nor did their own arm save them; but it was Your right hand, Your arm, and the light of Your countenance, because You favoured them…Through You we will push down our enemies; through Your name we will trample those who rise up against us. <sup> </sup>For I will not trust in my bow, nor shall my sword save me.<br />But You have saved us from our enemies and have put to shame those who hated us. <sup> </sup>In God we boast all day long and praise Your name forever.”</h1><p>Here, David outlined God’s help in past situations. However, he continued to also detail the way in which God had not protected him from certain bad events and trials.</p><h1>Psa.44:9-16 – “But You have cast us off and put us to shame, and You do not go out with our armies. You make us turn back from the enemy, and those who hate us have taken spoil for themselves. You have given us up like sheep intended for food and have scattered us among the nations.<sup> </sup>You sell Your people for next to nothing…<sup> </sup>You make us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to those all around us. <sup> </sup>You make us a byword among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples. <sup> </sup>My dishonour is continually before me,<br />And the shame of my face has covered me…”</h1><h1>And amid all this, David said, “… but we had not forgotten you; we had not dealt falsely with your covenant. Our hearts had not turned back; our feet had not strayed from your path.  But you crushed us and … covered us over with deep darkness” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%2044:17-19&amp;version=NIV&amp;src=tools#_blank">Psalm 44:17-19</a>). </h1><h1>In the rest of the psalm, David prayed that God will yet turn things around and help him; yet he was honest that despite his obedience and faith in God, things had not gone well and God had allowed him to suffer.</h1><p><br />But this is where faith comes in. Faith is not the certainty that God will not ever let bad things happen to us. It is the certainty that He will not let anything happen to us without a purpose, and unless they are for our ultimate benefit. Hence, faith is not something we exercise to keep everything going well – authentic faith is demonstrated most powerfully when things go wrong. </p><p>God will often protect us from bad events. However, if He does not, He has a purpose in mind. That is where faith comes in, and where we are able to resonate with Job: “Though he slay me, yet will I trust him” (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job%2013:15&amp;version=NIV&amp;src=tools#_blank">Job 13:15</a>).<br /><br />So, do not be discouraged if things sometimes do not go well in life “despite” our faith and our love for God. Faith is not a promise that everything will always go well, but it does guarantee that despite setbacks, we will reach our destination and we will ultimately end well.</p><h1>2 Tim.4:18 – “And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work and <em>preserve me for His heavenly kingdom</em>. To Him <em>be</em> glory forever and ever. Amen!”</h1><h1><em>Definition of ‘Good’</em></h1><p>This scripture also reminds us that although sin and Satan are powerful, God is more powerful; He is able to redeem and restore anything for our good and His glory. All things may not be good, but God can and will use all things for good. But more importantly, the verse continues to give us the definition of ‘Good’ that God promises those who continue to love Him despite trials and suffering.</p><p>“For those God foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers” <em>(v. 29). </em></p><p>The word "good" does not necessarily mean happy or painless or financial success, or our idea of the best possible outcome. God's ultimate good for us is that we conform into the likeness of Jesus, so that He may glorify us in eternity.</p><p>God allows everything into our lives for one of two purposes—either to bring us into a relationship with Himself or, if we already know Him, to make us more like His Son. That is the key. There is no higher good than to be like the Lord Jesus Christ. If the goal of our lives is not to be like Jesus, then that goal is too small. </p><p>Perhaps the greatest comfort is in the first three words, “And we know.” This is not “perhaps” or “maybe”; this is ironclad certainty, ‘That <a href="https://www.crosswalk.com/faith/bible-study/3-things-you-never-noticed-in-romans-8-28.html">all things work together for good</a>’. </p><p>That assures us that no suffering is wasted, and God is always at work for our good and His glory. Behind history is the God of the Bible who is sovereignly orchestrating good for His people through painful situations, turning what was meant for evil around for the good of His people, to empower us and transforming us to be more like Jesus Christ. Rather than living in bitterness, resentment and anger, as is often the case for many Christians, these truths should comfort us and commission us to rest in His Sovereignty by faith! </p>
