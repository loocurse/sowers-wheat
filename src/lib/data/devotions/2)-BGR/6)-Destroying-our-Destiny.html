<h1><strong>Devotion 6 – Destroying our Destiny </strong></h1><p>The word of God leaves us in no doubt that we are created through Him and for Him and His purposes alone. </p><h1>“All things were created through Him and for Him” (Col.1:16). </h1><p>We exist because of God, and we are here only for the purposes of God. There is therefore not one person who is without a purpose in God.</p><p>“For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which <strong>God prepared beforehand </strong>that we should walk in them.” (Eph.2:10).</p><p>What kind of good works was Paul referring to? The `good works’ spoken by Paul are described as the good works that God has prepared for each one of us beforehand--even before we came into existence on this earth. </p><p>God told Jeremiah<strong>, </strong>“Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.” (Jer.1:5). Paul told Timothy not to be ashamed of the Gospel, through which God “has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus <strong>before time began”. (</strong>2Tim.1:9). </p><p>Samuel, Jeremiah, Samson, Jacob, John the Baptist, Paul and Jesus Himself were all prophesied of before they came into the world. Hence, we see that prior to our conversion, and even before we were born, God had already mapped out a spiritual plan for us to fulfil His highest purpose. </p><p>Therefore, our responsibility as believers is to find His will for us and to obey it. We only need to yield ourselves to His plan. When we depart from this earth, we will stand before our Lord Jesus and be required to give an account to Him to the extent to which we have fulfilled His will for us in our lives<strong>. </strong>“So then, each of us shall give an account of himself to God” (Rom.14:12). </p><p>Peter clearly instructs us to “be diligent in <strong>making our calling and election sure</strong>, for if we do these things, we will never stumble” (2Pet.1:10). The key to a consistent and conscientious Christian walk is therefore to know and be certain of our call in the Lord. </p><p>For that reason, Paul warns us in 1Cor.15:33 – “Do not be deceived: “Evil company corrupts good habits”. </p><h1>How can union with someone in darkness helps us to walk in the light to fulfill our destiny?</h1><h1>Soulmate vs. Sole mate</h1><p>A soulmate is a person ideally suited to another as a close friend or romantic partner. On the other hand, a sole mate is someone who walks with us into our destiny. (The ‘sole’ of a shoe). </p><p>Do not compromise on this and marry an unequally yoked or spiritually anemic spouse, as he or she will derail us from our calling and destiny. If we want a spiritually rich marriage, and the goal of our marriage is to build a life together to glorify God and fulfill our calling and destiny, then spiritual compatibility is very important. If two builders are trying to build two different houses on the same foundation, the building is going to collapse.</p><h1>Three legged Race</h1><p>A marriage is like a three-legged race. Even if both parties are champion sprinters, we can’t win the race until and unless we learn to synchronize our steps and work together. Many couples are frustrated and their marriage fail miserably because they are simply “dragging” their spouse along instead of synchronizing their pace with them to effectively run the three-legged race.</p><h1>Amos3:3 – “Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?”  </h1><p>An unequally yoked spouse will definitely have a different worldview, different values, perspective and goals in life. If we are truly mission-minded and wanted to fulfill the plan and purpose of God in our life, then we should consider our future spouse carefully. Seek not only for a soulmate but most importantly seek for a sole mate, one who will help you and walk with you into eternity to fulfill your call in this life.</p>
