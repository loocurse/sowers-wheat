<h1>Devotion 20 – Jesus’ Teaching on Singlehood</h1><p>Should singleness be endured as another of the necessary trials in the Christian life? Should we view singleness as suffering? Is our singleness a gift or a grief? Probably these are some of the many questions singles silently struggle with in their private lives.</p><h1>Matthew 19:10-12 – “His disciples said to Him, “If such is the case of the man with <em>his</em> wife, it is better not to marry.”<sup> 11</sup>But He said to them, “All cannot accept this saying, but only <em>those</em> to whom it has been given: For there are eunuchs who were born thus from <em>their</em> mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake. He, who is able to accept <em>it, </em>let him accept <em>it.”</em></h1><p>“Eunuch” in this context means people who remain single and celibate. The single life is a special calling from God, and it is given to some to be single. It is not a failure or a mark of defeat to remain unmarried.  </p><p>Jesus described three classes of eunuchs - those who are from birth, those who have been made eunuchs by men, and those who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven</p><h1>“Born eunuchs”  </h1><p>Due to circumstances and reasons which make it impossible or unwise to marry, like being sexually impotent, mentally challenged, physically disabled, etc.</p><h1>“Made eunuchs by men” </h1><h1>Could be due to accidents, childhood trauma, wrong teaching (1Tim.4:1-3), etc.</h1><h1>“Made themselves eunuch”</h1><p>By choice for the sake of the kingdom of God. For in the ancient world, a court eunuch was one who set aside sexual activity (either from a congenital defect or as a result of physical castration) for the sake of a devoted and loyal service to the king. Since the eunuch could not have children or a dynasty of his own, he could be more trusted in his loyalty to the monarch whom he served. Likewise, without wife or family, the ‘spiritual eunuch’ also has additional time for service to his king and can serve him in a completely dedicated fashion. </p><p>If you fall into this classification, then be content with singleness; receive it, and embrace it. Accept your circumstances fully -- do not fight them, or resent them; do not constantly battle against the solitary life and feel embittered. Trust fully on the sovereignty of God and that He has our ultimate good in mind.</p><p>One thing noteworthy is that when Paul or Jesus spoke of singleness as a gift, they were not referring to a particular ability to be contentedly single, without any sexual drive or the need to love or be loved by someone. Rather, they were speaking of the state of being single. As long as you have it, it’s a gift from God; just as marriage is God’s gift if you should receive it. We should accept our situation in life, whether it is singleness or marriage, as a gift of God’s grace to us.</p><h1>We must resist the thinking that singleness is second best. Marriage is good, but so is singleness. </h1>
