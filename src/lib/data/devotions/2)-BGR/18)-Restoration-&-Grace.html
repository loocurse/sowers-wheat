<h1><strong>Devotion 18 – Forgiving Ourselves </strong></h1><p>Many books have been written and many sermons have been preached on forgiveness. We all know that as children of God, we are supposed to forgive others as Jesus has forgiven us. </p><p>However, very few books or sermons address the issue of forgiving ourselves. Many children of God are tormented with shame, guilt and condemnation, especially in the areas of sexual immorality. This is commonly due to our wrong understanding on the nature and character of God the Father.</p><p>When we give our lives to Jesus, we still sin due to the weaknesses of our flesh. However, when we fall short, God’s grace makes us pure again as long as we continue to have a tender and humble heart before Him.</p><h1>Ps.51:17 - “A broken and a contrite heart – these, O God, You will not despise” </h1><p>One of the things that help us relate to Jesus as a personal savior is that He has been there and can relate to us on the basis of humanity.</p><h1>Hebrews 4:15 – “For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect was tempted as we are…”</h1><p>And because he can fully sympathize with us, He fully understands our genuine struggles, frustration and pain. Therefore, He will not deal and punish us according to our sins and iniquities if we have a God fearing and repentant heart.<strong> </strong>Instead, in affirming His grace, compassion and mercy, He promises to remove our transgressions to an infinite distance. The slate is clean!  He pities us the way parents pity their own children. How many of us parents monitor our children with the desire to punish them when they do something wrong?  It breaks our hearts to have to do it.</p><p>Ps.103:11-13 –“He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor punished us according to our iniquities. For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is His mercy toward those who fear him; <strong>as far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us. </strong>As a father pities his children, so the Lord pities those who fear Him”</p><p>Isa.1:18 - “Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool” </p><p>1Jn.1:9 - “If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” </p><h1>Virginity vs. Purity </h1><p>We cannot restore our virginity when we lose it, however, God can restore back our purity. Do not let yourself be imprisoned by guilt and shame. He forgives, purifies &amp; makes us whole again.</p><p>There are two kinds of sin; sin of disobedience and sin of unbelief.  Many a times, the sin of disobedience is due to the weakness of our flesh, but the sin of unbelief in the cleansing power of the blood is due to the lack of faith. If we claim to be unworthy after the Blood of Christ has made us worthy, then we are denying the work of Christ in our lives! Most Christian believes enough to be saved but not enough to enjoy the abundance of life in the kingdom. If you have failed in the areas of sexual immorality, it’s not an unpardonable sin. Strengthen your heart to rest in God’s loving kindness &amp; mercy. </p><p>Father, I desire to be obedient in my sexual life. Today I turn from all my sin and hints of sexual immorality and turn toward your Love &amp; Grace. Cleanse me from my past mistakes and help me to remain pure and strong in the future. I am sorry I have strayed. Thank you Jesus for your precious blood and forgiveness. Amen!</p>
