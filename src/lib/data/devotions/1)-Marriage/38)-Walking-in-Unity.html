<h1><strong>Devotion for Marriages – Walking in Unity</strong></h1><h1>Amos 3:3 – “Can two walk together, unless they are agreed?”</h1><p>To have a marriage relationship which grows in intimacy and oneness and yes, one which optimistically believes that the best is yet to come, unity is vital. Never do anything without first establishing an <em>enthusiastic </em>agreement with each other.</p><p>A marriage is like a three-legged race. Even if both parties are champion sprinters, we can’t win the race until and unless we learn to work together. Many couples are frustrated and their marriage fail miserably because they are simply “dragging” their spouse along instead of synchronizing their pace with them to effectively run the three-legged race.</p><p>Many wives are filled with resentment because they feel they are forced to walk in “fate” rather than faith as their husbands do not lead them to seek the Lord or pray through a decision together, but instead they just expect their wives to submit and follow their wishes, whatever these may be. </p><p>Husbands, never just say, “thus says the Lord”, and expect your wives to submit but instead, we should always lead our spouses to seek the Lord and pray through the decision together. Wives will feel insecure when their husbands do not communicate with them but just simply make decisions without prior discussion, thinking they have the right to do so as the head of the home.</p><p>Gen.2:24 – “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife and they shall become one flesh”</p><p>“One flesh”, but which “One”? Most of the time, the one with the stronger character will think that they are the “One” and the other party should follow them. But being one flesh actually means being one heart and one mind in our decision making, with no party regarded as superior to the other.</p><p>Eph.6:10-11 – “Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. <strong><sup> </sup></strong>Put on the full armour of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes”</p><p>One of the “schemes of the devil” is to cause division in this one-flesh relationship. The word “Di” in the Latin prefix means “two”. Thus, “division” means two visions or to see two different things.  The devil wants to get the husband &amp; wife to have two different visions, or to see things in two different ways so there will be disunity in the marriage.</p><p>Praying and seeking the Lord together regularly unites our spirit and vision and destroys the schemes of the evil one who tries to bring division in our “one” relationship intended by the Lord.</p>
