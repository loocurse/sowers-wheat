<h1><em>Priesthood in the Family</em></h1><p>1Cor.11:3 – “But I want you to know that the head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God”</p><p>In this verse, three heads are mentioned; God the head of Christ; Christ the head of man and man the head of woman. This means that in the same way that Christ represents God to the man, the man is responsible to represent Christ to his wife, and by implication, to his family.  And there are basically three main ministries of Christ in which the husband should represent Him to his family: as Prophet, King and Priest.  Spiritual leadership is pivotal and indispensable if the husband truly desires to provide true emotional security to his wife.</p><h1><em>Father as Priest</em></h1><p>A father’s success as priest will determine his success as prophet and king. If he succeeds as priest, he will probably succeed in the other two ministries. But if he does not represent himself correctly to be priest of his family, it will be difficult for him to be either the prophet or the king.</p><h1><em>Word – To Guide &amp; Lead the Family according to Biblical Principles</em></h1><p>Hos.4:6 – “My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you from being a priest for Me…”</p><p><strong>How are the people of Israel destroyed from a lack of knowledge? </strong>What was it that Israel did not know, and why was that lack of knowledge so dangerous?<br /><br />It’s important to note the structure of the verse: “rejected knowledge” is parallel to “forgotten the law.” That means the people did not simply lack knowledge; they actively rejected it. But that is because the priest first rejected it.</p><p>Many families are destroyed, become dysfunctional because the husbands, the priests of the household are dangerously lacking in the knowledge of God’s Word, or they blatantly ignore and rejected the biblical principles of managing the family.</p><p>Malachi 2:7 – “For the lips of a priest should keep knowledge, and people should seek the law from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts”</p><p>This also applies to a father as priest. Whenever the family is unsure, in a dilemma, needing guidance, it is the father’s responsibility to guide or coach it with biblical wisdom.</p><p>Rom.12:2 - “And do not be conformed to the world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.”</p><p>As priests in the household, we are supposed to guide and instruct them into the perfect will of God according to the Word. Our family can perish due to our ignorance of God’s word. </p><p>When your wife knows that every decision you make is according to the standard of God’s word, she feels secure. Hence, her security is not in you but rather in God through you.</p><p>The greatest crisis in family life today is often due to the biblical illiteracy or the hardened heart of the father who ignores the wisdom of God’s word to guide the family. </p><h1>Prayer – To Establish the family in the Perfect will of God</h1><p>1 Sam.12:23 – “Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you, but I will teach you the good and the right way.</p><p>Samuel was also required to play the role of priest, prophet and king over Israel.  Being the Judge of Israel, Samuel recognized he would sin against God if he did not pray and teach the way of the Lord to the children of Israel, because he was their leader and has the responsibility to watch over them spiritually. Likewise, as fathers, we have the same responsibility over our families as they are under our stewardship. </p><p>Heb.13:17 – “Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive for they watch out for your souls as those who must give account.”</p><p>Spiritual leaders are expected to watch over the souls of those under them and to ultimately give an account to God. How can we ‘watch over’ the souls of our family members?</p><p>Col.4:12 – “Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, greets you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God”</p><p>Epaphras labored fervently in prayers for the Colossian Church. To play the role of the priest effectively for the family, every father should learn from Epaphras, to be an intercessor and stand in the gap for his family, to watch over his soul and pray fervently so that the family will stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</p><p>As priests of our families, we have the responsibility to teach our families the way of the Lord and like Job, and to bear up our children continuous before God in prayer. We see today how many children and youths are lost, aimless and under the captivity of Satan because they have no fathers to intercede for them.</p><h1>Points to Ponder:</h1><h1>Husbands and Fathers, are we diligent in the Word &amp; in Prayer for our families?</h1>
