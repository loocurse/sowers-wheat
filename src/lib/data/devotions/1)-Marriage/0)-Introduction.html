<p>Strong godly marriages don’t just happen. They require commitment, time, and faith―which can often be difficult to practise, amid the hustle and bustle of our busy daily lives. However, these diligence and dedication are essential and they are keys to staying married, growing in romantic intimacy and oneness.</p><p>Since 2010, we have been ministering in many nations, teaching on the subject of God’s intended intimacy in marriage to churches, missionaries and spiritual leaders. These devotional materials explain the core values of our teaching.</p><p>We hope that as you meditate on these devotions and process it together as a couple, it will help to bring healing, strength and restoration to your marriage. And by the grace of God, it will help the both of you to ignite prayerfully, connect meaningfully and deepen the relational, physical, emotional, and spiritual aspects of your relationship while renewing your shared commitment to your marriage and faith so that you can continue to shine for His kingdom and impact the next generation. Like any couple, we don’t have a perfect marriage, but it’s a marriage we thank God for every day.</p><p>It is our most ardent and sincere prayer for every couple who meditates on these devotions that God will richly bless and enrich your marriage, so that you are among those that will help to rebuild the walls of broken marriages (Nehemiah 4), have the burden to  build old waste places, raise up the foundations of many generations, be the repairer of breach and restorer of streets to many families (Isaiah 58:12) and be a global voice, so that through you the nations may be blessed (Genesis 12:3), because your God will fight for you!</p>
