<h1>Hi Friends,</h1><p>We hope that you have been blessed after reading these first three devotions which focus on praying together as a couple. Mae and I have been married for almost twenty six years, and we must testify that praying together is one of the most important discipline of a Christian marriage and it has helped our marriage stay healthy and steadfast in the midst of all the struggles and trials we experienced as a Christian couple.  </p><p>We hope that you will take the time to meditate, discuss with your spouse, pray over and implement the principles learnt in these devotions in your marriage. Instead of trying desperately to work out your own problems, why not come together to look unto the grace of God to build your marriage?</p><p>Let me share four simple prayer pointers of how we sustained our prayer life together for the last 25 years.</p><p>First, we take turns to prayer, with one of us praying on alternate nights. We begin by giving thanks for His providence over the events of the day, and praying for those who cross our path that day.</p><h1>1Thess.5:18 – “In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you”</h1><p>Secondly, we pray for the event which we will encounter the next day and commit it to the Lord, and also for any upcoming event in the near future.</p><h1>Prov.3:6 – “In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths”</h1><p>Thirdly, we pray for the providence of God constantly over our family and ministry and that we may always be established in the perfect will of God.</p><p>Col.4:12 – “Always labouring fervently in prayers that we may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God”</p><p>Fourthly, we intercede for our friends and those in need and also for those who have requested for our prayers.</p><p>Caution:  Never used the opportunity of praying together to manipulate your spouse to change. Pray together in sincerity and in humility before God instead of using God to get what you want from your spouse.</p><h1>For this discipline to be fully effective, a daily commitment to follow through is required. </h1><p>It is our prayer that as you go through the rest of the devotions with us, it will help you, as a couple to make praying together a priority in your own marriage.  We pray that you will begin to experience the growth in oneness and the intimacy and synergy that God desires in a marriage, and  that you too will begin to disciple other couples and help them make praying together a priority in their marriages.</p><p>We believe that God is looking for couples who are willing to give Him a dedicated time so that they can develop a deeper relationship together with Him. </p><p>We would like to challenge you to start setting praying together as a priority today. Whether you are newly married or have celebrated your golden anniversary, it’s never too late to begin.</p><h1>Will you join us on this journey?</h1><p><em>P.S. – The next devotion will only be send out on the 21<sup>st</sup> of June due to my ministry travelling schedule. Will be in Taiwan from 7<sup>th</sup>-19<sup>th</sup> June. Covet your prayers!</em></p><h1>Blessing,</p><p>Adrian</h1>
