<h1><strong>Paul’s Second Epistle to the Corinthians</strong></h1><p>Second Corinthians, Paul’s second letter to the Corinth Church followed shortly after his first one to them.  Unlike the first, this letter is intensely personal and the words used by Paul are like the language of his heart towards the Corinth church.</p><p><strong>“O Corinthians!  We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open.” (2 Cor. 6:11)</strong></p><p>Written in a noticeably less systematic manner than Paul’s other letters and, unveiling his very own emotions as he communicates in a most personal way with the church he birthed, Second Corinthians allows us to read it affectionately as if looking into the dictates of the apostle’s heart.  It is hence important, in order to gain infinitely more, to go beyond the superficial phase of getting an academic grasp of the things Paul is saying in his letter to understanding him and his heartbeat toward the Corinthian church.  Moreover, because so much of Paul’s inner thoughts and heart is revealed here, it helps us if we take the effort to check and see how our own values and intentions measure up against his.  It is our hope, as we diligently take time to meditate upon the words of Paul and ponder over his convictions as reflected in his letter, that we will be encouraged by his example to constantly maintain clarity of conscience and indeed, sincere motives, as we do the Lord’s work.  This letter is like a torch that searches and examines our hearts when we evaluate and deal with our attitude as we serve in God’s ministry.</p><h1><strong>Background</strong></h1><p>Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians was written in reproof of the people’s amoral and ungodly attitudes, which came to his knowledge after he received a report on the church.  His second letter to them commended the majority who has humbly repented of their ways, in response to his earlier reproof, but at the same time rebuked the rebellious minority who remained impenitent despite his rebuke.</p><h1> </p><p><strong>1)	An account of Paul’s ministry (2 Cor. 1 - 7) </strong></h1><p>The initial seven chapters of Second Corinthians give an account of Paul’s ministry as an apostle of Christ.  Here, his ministry values, personal principles and innermost thoughts come as an augury of what we can expect in true Christian ministry; reflecting the price one has to pay in serving the Lord, the problems we are likely to encounter from time to time and, the responsibilities involved in ministering to His people.  </p><h1><strong>A Shepherd’s Heart</strong></h1><p><strong>“Futhermore, when I came to Traos to preach Christ’s gospel, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,..” (2 Cor. 2:12)</strong></p><p>While Paul was in Troas, a door was opened to him to preach the gospel.  This appears, at first impression, to be an opportunity provided by the Lord for spiritual work and accordingly, for spiritual reward.  It would have added significantly to the success that Paul was already having in his ministry to make it even more impressive.  However, Paul explained that he did not respond to this opportunity, as Titus, who assisted in conveying the condition of the Corinthian church in Paul’s absence, was not with him.  It is debatable, but will perhaps still remain unclear after that, as to whether or not Paul was disobedient to the call of God on this occasion by not preaching the gospel in Troas.  Nevertheless, one thing that is clear is his genuine love for the Corinthian church - one that is so intense Paul was all ready and set to forego the coveted reputation of planting yet another church and even more so, receiving his reward from God. </p><p>Though never once a pastor of any church, yet we see in this instance, Paul displaying by the words of his letter, the undisputed care and love of a shepherd towards his flock.  In the same way, while the call to pastor a church may rest only upon a few in the Body of Christ, all of us nevertheless have the responsibility to ensure our love for God’s people remains the foundation of whatever dealing or ministry we have with them. </p><h1><strong>The Price of Ministry (2 Cor. 1:3-6,8; 6:3-10)</strong></h1><p>It is often said that `Nothing in this world is free’.  How true it is, at least to the extent our salvation is concerned.  While you and I received salvation as a free gift from God, it was nonetheless something not granted us except at the price of His only Son.  Assuredly, where one receives something for free, we can be sure it is because somebody else had already paid the price for it.  In other words, it is free for us, but certainly not for the giver who bought it.  Similarly, if the Body of Christ is to receive blessing, those who serve will have to pay the price for that to happen.  Leaders, if the members are to receive God’s blessings, you will have to be the ones paying the price for it.  Paul paid a price so that the Corinthians could benefit from it.  They were sustained in times of pain and suffering because they drew comfort from Paul who had gone through similar experiences.  That the people in Corinth may know the warmth and comfort of being whole, Paul experienced the pain and cold of brokenness.</p><p><strong>“Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.” (2 Cor. 1:6)</strong></p><p>In order for the church to continually benefit from the stream of God’s blessings, the leaders have to be the ones working the hardest to bring about that evolution.  Members can freely receive, but not before the leaders have freely given of themselves.  For this reason, God’s servants may at times even be put to experience intense measure of suffering so that they find themselves in better positions to identify with the struggles and frailty of humanity.  We are able to bring comfort to others with the comfort we received from the Lord during the times of our adversity (2 Cor 1:3-6).  We may bleed from a wound now, but our scar in the future will tell and remind other casualties that their wounds will one day close and heal.  Very often, God in his great wisdom allows his chosen vessel to go through greater measure of trials and tribulations so that with the sacrifice of that one person, many can be touched and healed.  A classic example of this is the observation that many ministers operating powerfully in the healing anointing were once themselves victims of pain and disease in their own bodies and who had been miraculously delivered. </p><p>This principle was illustrated to me one day when I came across a picture of Simon, the Cyrenian carrying the cross for Jesus.  At that moment, the Spirit showed me that we are all called to be “Simons “and are called to suffer as Simon did when he bore the cross on Jesus’ behalf.  Although Jesus alone was sentenced to bear the cross, Simon was, however, called to help Him along the way.  Paul says in <strong>Col 1:24</strong> that he <strong>“fills up in (his) flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ for the sake of His body, which is the church”</strong>.  Concerning this, I queried the Lord many times.  How can Christ’s affliction be described as lacking when He was believed to have completed the work on the cross once and for all?  Surely whatever that needed to be done must have already been done by the Lord Jesus’ death on the cross?  However, the Lord revealed to me that because Christ has already suffered and is now glorified, the numerous hurts and needs that are present today can only be met through members of the Body of Christ who are willing to pay the price that He did.  Like Simons, we are to help Him shoulder the cross until the full redemption of the earth. </p><h1><strong>Sincerity and Integrity</strong></h1><h1>At all the times that he spent with the church, Paul kept his conscience clear and without blame.  </h1><p><strong>“For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience that we conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God.”  (2 Cor. 1:12)</strong></p><p>With a conscience that is spotless before the lamp of the Spirit that searches the hearts of men, Paul found himself always able to stand up to whatever accusations people had against him.  The peace he has within his conscience was sufficient cushion against the hurts he felt from all the finger pointing he got from the crowds.  So sure was he of the uprightness of his conscience that he knew it would vindicate him before God.  With that, he defended himself before the Corinthians who threw doubts on his integrity when he failed to visit them as originally planned.</p><p>Paul had initially planned a visit to the Corinthians, but had to abort the idea when issues arose concerning his ministry in that church, making it better for him not to see them as originally planned.  Jealous teachers at that time used this to fault him and discredit his ministry, even to the extent of affronting the trustworthiness and faithfulness of God, to which Paul was most indignant.  He asserted that he was not in the least being irresolute or plainly careless by vacillating his plans to visit them.  He defended that his ministry among them had all along been an unblemished testimony of God’s consistency; at the same time not hesitating to add that the reason why he would never again make another trip to them was so that they might be spared of the judgment he knew he would bring upon them if he were to see them in their ungodly state.  The abandoned trip to Corinth was a prelude to Paul’s way of showing mercy, followed by his writing to them to give them a chance to repent instead of visiting them with judgment and wrath.</p><h1> </h1><p>Paul’s brush with the Corinthians in this instance should bring us to the awareness of how our words and way of life have a bearing on people around us.  It is very important for us to always show that we mean what we say by endeavouring, as far as possible, to fulfil the words we say.  Make it a good practice to remind ourselves from time to time to be careful in what we say, not being casual with our words (Prov 29:20).  It is only too easy for men to speak freely, therefore, do not be hasty with your words, but speak in prudence.  Before they heed and take after our eagerness to keep God’s word, people around us must first be convinced that we can keep our own word.</p><p>The name of God is too holy and awesome to be made a subject of human ridicule.  We should therefore take extra care in ensuring that our life and ministry give no place for offence to be caused to His name.  Like Paul, let us <strong>“give no offence to anything, that our ministry may not be blamed” (2 Cor. 6:3-4)</strong>.  Our names are written in the Book of Life today because of God’s love for us; let us not return evil for good by bringing unnecessary shame and blasphemy to His Name because of our negligence in daily affairs.</p><p>Paul made it a point to give no place for hidden agenda for as long as he served the Lord, striving always <strong>“to have a conscience without offence toward God and men”</strong> (Acts 24:16).  His way of life, movements and all, were laid plain before men.  Paul was never afraid of having people know the truth about him, whatever that may be, simply because he knows he would never be ashamed of the truth about himself.  He maintained a clear conscience throughout by living a life above reproach.  The attention we, as believers, need to pay to this aspect of our lives, cannot be over-emphasized.  Even as it applies to all who serves in the Lord’s ministry, the same principle should be practiced in our lives for our own edification:</p><p><strong>“Having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck.” (1 Tim. 1:19)</strong></p><p>Paul warns of the potential devastation that can happen to our faith (a spiritual shipwreck) when we do not live with a good conscience.  One of the primary ways the Holy Spirit guides us is in speaking through our consciences.  We need therefore to maintain a clear and undefiled conscience so as to always be sure that the Holy Spirit’s way of moving in our conscience is not in any way hampered.  However, keeping our conscience clear is still not enough, if we want to do its purpose full justice.  We need to be willing to yield to the promptings coming from it, since God speaks to us through our consciences.  Each time we choose to suppress the voice of our conscience instead of giving heed to it, it is like applying a coat of glue over it.  Over time, as more layers of glue cover our conscience, it becomes seared.  That is when our hearts harden itself against the Holy Spirit’s prompting and in time to come, His gentle voice will be shut out from our lives altogether. </p><h1><strong>Judgment administered in love (2 Cor. 2:4-8)</strong></h1><p>In his first letter to the Corinthians, Paul rebuked them for their amoral and flippant attitudes.  In particular, he made specific mention of dealing with the man who had committed sexual sin with his father’s wife (1 Cor. 5).  Paul rebuked the church for putting up with the man and his transgression, and charged them that because they should love another to the extent that they rejoice in truth and hate sin, they should therefore deal appropriately with him and lead him out of transgression.  In this, Paul commanded that they should even put the errant person out of the church’s fellowship for as long as he chooses to remain in his sin, and receive him back only when he is willing to repent of his sins and be reconciled with righteousness, which they eventually did.  In saying that, Paul also reminded them that though judgement should be meted out, it should however not be devoid of love.  He taught them to love enough to build up whenever necessary.</p><p>It was a severe measure for the Corinthians to have taken against their brother, but because of that, the brother repented of his sin as the church also repented of their indifferent attitude in that matter (2 Cor. 7:7).  We see, therefore, that at times, offence is inevitable and often enough, we find ourselves having to haul the coal over in order to accomplish God's purpose.  Paul bravely declares that he makes no apologies whatsoever for what he wrote in his first letter to the Corinthian church, because his words had led them to godly sorrow, which in turn brought them to genuine repentance.  Likewise, we need to be sure and certain of the perfection in God’s precepts, taking courage in same, developing strong moral fibre so as to stand our ground and not cower when the circumstances call for correction and chastisement.</p><p>Having said that, however, we ought also to remember that all things should be done in love.  It was recorded of David that though his son Absalom had rebelled and thus deserved death, he however cried when Absalom was eventually killed: <strong>“The king was much moved and went up to the chamber over the gate and wept.”</strong> (2 Sam.18:23).   While Absalom was a traitor who hardly gave a care for David, David, as a father, was however filled with sorrow at his son’s death penalty.  Absalom had committed a transgression deserving judgement, which was accordingly delivered; yet, David’s tears flowed.  Judgement administered coldly without the slightest compassion or softest tears exposes a frightening state where the love that should be in us is deficient.  If there is only condemnation but not compassion or distress for the people, then we are faced with a frightening void in our fellowship which needs to be quickly filled.</p><h1><strong>Ministers of the new covenant (2 Cor. 3:5-6)</strong></h1><p>Paul continues in his letter to describe how we should serve the Lord as ministers of the new covenant.  Life under the new covenant is one governed by the Holy Spirit and not by the Law.  Therefore, ministry under the new covenant should therefore be one that involves the impartation of life and not merely the manifestation of our gifting in that area.  Like the ministry of teaching, for example, we seek to go beyond the dissemination of knowledge and information which only heightens the spiritual enlightenment of our hearers without bringing transformation to their hearts, to ministering to them ways that bear the guidance of the Spirit.  More people are now learning that the most effective ministry is not to draw up a spiritual agenda on our own, but to seek Him concerning His desired word for the people, then teach only what has been instructed.</p><h1><strong>Ministers of truth (2 Cor. 4:1-2)</strong></h1><p>Besides the aspect of delivering God’s word in an acceptable way, another non-negligible facet to the ministry of the Word is our practice of it.  Before we can urge the masses to live out our words, we have to show them, by our lifestyles that what they have heard from us is kept by us personally.</p><p><strong>“The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat.  Therefore whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do according to their works; for they say, and do not do.” (Matt. 23:3)</strong></p><p>Those in “Moses’ seat” are those who have been conferred leadership authority over the people.  Leaders are thus reminded that our words should be shadowed by our actions so that people may see that we do not stray from our words but that we observe what has been preached or taught from our lips.  The teachings from a true minister of God’s word would be reinforced by his practice of it.  Teaching, if not accompanied by a life that echoes it will soon fade in impression in the hearts of its hearers.  Such ministry is one practiced apart from life, and it not just deny the power of the authority of God in what is being taught, but also the conviction of the Holy Spirit that would otherwise transform the hearts of its hearers.  Let us therefore yield to the Spirit, and be led by Him in every conceivable aspect of our life and ministry under the new Covenant.  We are not called to pile weight or heap eminence and popularity on ourselves or on our ministries, but to impart the life and strength of God to His church.</p><h1><strong>Serving with an eternal perspective (2 Cor. 4:7-12; 5:9-11)</strong></h1><p>Having commanded that ministers of God’s word should handle their responsibilities with reverence and discharge them faithfully, Paul’s latter words tell us that even if we keep that part of our responsibility, it is not a guarantee that we would be free from trouble.  Paul warned that in serving the Lord, there is the inevitable persecution that we have to constantly battle.  This is when we need all the more to serve with an eternal perspective so that we might prevail over the things happening around us.  </p><p><strong>“We are hard pressed on every side, yet not crushed; we are perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed …..” (2 Cor. 4:8-10)</strong></p><p>Ever since he dedicated himself to serving the Lord, Paul’s life was one fraught with much pain and suffering.  That was a fulfilment of the Lord’s words spoken to Ananias in that Paul had to suffer much for the sake of the Lord’s work (Acts 9:16).  Indeed, enduring hardships became a way of life for Paul as the apostle stood steadfast and faithful unto the Lord.  However, Paul did not reach this without struggle – he had to battle despair and discouragement, nurse bleeding wounds and nasty sores, and even had to live with the pain of having a thorn in his flesh.  All these Paul endured, and did not despair on life, though fraught with troubles, persecution and all.  In fact, the more he was persecuted, the stronger he flexed his principles and the farther he stretched his faith.  The key to his determination lies in the eternal hope he dearly cherished and held on to, convinced that what he suffered in the now was yielding a sure harvest and glory for the time which was to come.  This harvest and glory, Paul was certain, would significantly outweigh all the mass of pain and sacrifice he ever bore. <strong>“ For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,…”  (2 Cor.4:17)</strong></p><p>Similarly, it was when the Lord Jesus set his eyes on the glory that was to come, instead of the price He was to pay, that as a result was enabled to endure the pain of crucifixion, without which neither you nor I would stand redeemed today.  Therefore, it was Jesus’ godly perspective that made a difference in the destiny of the human race, making redemption and victorious living an attainable possibility for you and me today.  So like His Master whom <strong>“for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross” (Heb. 12:2)</strong>, Paul suffered the hardships in good cheer, all the while looking forward to the eternal hope in stored.  This is the kind of eternal perspective we should embrace also, if we serve the Lord.  For the way to the promises of God is a narrow and difficult one.  There is no other way to inherit them except through faith and patience:</p><p><strong>“And we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end, that you do not become sluggish, but imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.” (Heb. 6:11-12)</strong></p><p>So then, in view of the persecution that we will no doubt face while serving the Lord, let us not despair no matter how dark the surroundings, for above us lies a magnificent light that waits to receive us into glory when we finish our work here.  For that glorious hope, we press on therefore.  Looking to God for hope always, we shall not turn back once we have laid our hands to the plough.</p><h1><strong>2)	Attitudes of giving (2 Cor. 8 – 9)</strong></h1><p>In these two chapters, Paul was going about collections for the church in Judea who needed financial provisions when he took the opportunity to bring an exhortation to the Corinthians on giving to the Lord’s work.</p><h1><strong>Excel in the area of giving (2 Cor. 8:1-7)</strong></h1><p>At a time when collections were made for the presentation of offerings for people in Judea, Paul testified that the church in Macedonia gave freely and generously, in amounts beyond what was comfortable for them to give (2 Cor. 8:3).  In fact, Paul had apparently declined to receive their offering, but they <em>begged</em> him that he should accept (2 Cor. 8:4).</p><p>Paul gave thanks to God that the Macedonian church had been most generous in their giving, but noticing at the same time that the Corinthians were struggling in the area of giving, Paul began to teach them on how they could give acceptably unto the Lord.  Paul pointed out that the reason why the Macedonians could give of their finances so freely to the Lord was because they gave themselves first to the Lord.  When they surrendered themselves wholly to the Lord, and count their lives as His, that was the very thing that moved them to give all their other possessions to Him as well.</p><p><strong>“But they first gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God.” (2 Cor. 8:5)</strong></p><p>Beloved of God, when we struggle so hard with giving, could it be that we struggle too, with giving ourselves entirely to our Father, to allow Him to be Lord of all in our lives?  When we struggle with even allowing God to be Lord over our finances, how can we be so sure to believe we have made Him the Lord over our lives?  Yet, making Jesus the Lord of our lives is what we must all do, if we take Paul’s stand in Gal 2:20:  <strong>“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved and gave Himself for me.”</strong></p><p>People have problems in giving of their finances to God when they have not given of themselves to the Lord.  Therefore we still feel the pinch whenever money is removed from our pocket.  However, if we reckon ourselves as being crucified with Christ and dead to ourselves but alive to God like how Paul was (Gal. 2), then we wouldn’t find it so difficult to part with our possessions, for one who is supposedly “dead” will not feel the pinch.  It is only when we are still very aware of ourselves that we start to place a premium on material possessions as a form of security and treasure them so much that it pains us when the time comes for them to be given away.</p><p>When we die to self the way we are supposed to, we will cease to lay claim on any material possession, since we recognise our all to be Him and His.  We would have come to reckon that whatever we have comes from the Lord and belongs to Him.  We would have no reservations, at His instructions, in giving away what do not belong to us anyway.  Consequently, we will come to appreciate that as we give freely, we are at the same time set free from an attitude of self-centredness take a heart of love for the people dear to God. God is a giver and we, as His children, are called to reflect his likeness, even in this virtue of giving.  Like Paul’s charge to the church, let us <strong>“see that (we) abound in this grace (of giving) also” (2 Cor. 8:7).</strong></p><h1><strong>Fulfilling our promises; sharing our resources (2 Cor. 8:10-15)</strong></h1><p>The Corinthians had initially expressed intentions of gathering finances for the needy saints even before the Macedonians decided they want to do it as well.  By the principle of consistency or of integrity, they should have carried out what they said they were going to do, but after a year had passed, the Judean church had still not received any funds or provisions whatsoever from them.  The Corinthians were still way behind their plans, and no concrete actions had been taken since.  This was exactly what Paul addressed.  Whatever the reason for delay, Paul told them they ought to have honoured their words and fulfilled the things they had once promised to do and was eager about.  Perhaps they had wanted to wait for the collection to reach a bigger amount before they present it to the Judean church, but even if that was so, they ought to have, as far as possible, done what was within their ability in order to keep their words.  Even if that means making a smaller offering, it is still superior to not honouring their words at all.  We are reminded that it is not how much we give, but the attitude towards giving, that matters.  However small our offering may be, God receives and takes delight in the sincere heart that offers it nevertheless.</p><p> Paul taught that their fathers suffered no lack in the wilderness because they did not withhold anything from one another but were free in sharing the manna among themselves.  <strong>“He who gathered much had nothing left over, and he who gathered little had no lack” (2 Cor. 8:15)</strong>.  He instructed that the ones who had more than sufficient should give to the ones who can barely make ends meet:  <strong>“that now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack – that there may be equality.”  (2 Cor. 8:14)  </strong></p><p>When God rained down manna from heaven, the Israelites were told to collect only what they thought was sufficient for them, not more than that.  The ones who had a surplus then shared their portions with those who under-collected.  Those days, Israel in the wilderness had no lack because they shared their manna with one another.  This manna, we are told, will rot if kept overnight.  Today, however, money will not rot for years and years if kept well, which is perhaps why there is no need for us to bring them out to give to those who are in lack of it.  Nevertheless, the Lord’s desire is not to see some of us living in abundance and luxury while our brother worries about his next meal.  He desires equality in this area, and we must be ready to share when we see ourselves being in a position to help our brother live more comfortably.  This is the heart of God when it comes to handling our provisions and possessions.  He wants us to cultivate the spirit of love and selflessness by sharing our things among one another.  It is convenient to give out of riches and out of a wealth of possessions, but it is when we give despite knowing that we will be left with less for ourselves after giving that we know it is through the enablement of the Spirit of the Lord that we find ourselves on the giving end.  How rich a feeling then to know the Lord has provided for His people through us!</p><h1><strong>Handling finances entrusted to us (2 Cor. 8:16-21)</strong></h1><p>On the receiving end, good stewardship requires that a money offering handed to us should be handled properly, that the use of it is well justified.</p><p>After gathering the offerings of the people, Paul was entrusted with a large sum of money that was to be administered to the Judeans.  This he did not make light of, but even sent a delegation to accompany the delivery of the money to Judea, in order to ensure the money goes through appropriate administration according to their intended uses.  Paul’s primary concern was: <strong>“avoiding this:  that anyone should blame us in this lavish gift which is administered by us” (2 Cor. 8:20).</strong>  </p><p>Eager to make sure that he could not be faulted on the administration of the money over which he was made steward of, Paul handled the money with remarkable prudence.  This is the attitude we should embrace towards money entrusted to us that have been addressed towards a particular cause.  We should not apply it to any other purpose except to its specified cause.  We ought to appreciate and trust God that whoever He chooses to bless is whoever that needs the blessing.  We should then unfold the blessing to them directly and not appropriate it otherwise.</p><h1><strong>Rewards of generous giving (2 Cor. 9:6-8,12-14)</strong></h1><p><strong>“He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.”  (2 Cor. 9:6)</strong></p><p>Each time that we sow, we will surely reap, for <strong>“while the earth remains, seed time and harvest, …… shall not cease” (Gen. 8:22). </strong> If you sow generously, you will reap generously, while he who sows sparingly will not get to reap an impressive harvest from his fields.  However, this is not to be taken as an equation suggesting that we are to expect returns based on how much we have given.  Rather, it is to tell us we need not fear the risk of not having enough for ourselves when we sow generously.  We will always have abundance for every good work if we give as the Lord instructs, because He has the power to add to the produce of the seed that we have sown so that we will have more to give again.  The rewards may not be in the way of increased cash inflow; it can come to us in other forms.  Paul highlights two areas in which blessings come when people sow generously:</p><p><strong>“through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men, and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding grace of God in you.”  (2 Cor. 9:13-14)</strong></p><p>By giving generously, we not only meet the needs of our brothers and sisters, but we are at the same time brought to a privileged position of being a vessel through which the name of God can be glorified as a result of the people having their needs met.  When people receive help, they give thanks to God.  We then become the vessels that indirectly inspire praise and glory for God.</p><p>Further, when people have benefited from our giving, they pray in our favour, and we reap that too!  Like how we bless them with material supplies, they also bless us in return with spiritual coverings.</p><p>So, though blessings of generous giving may come to us in ways other than that of material riches, we can be sure that because of the fact that God is good, and indeed rich enough not give us less than what we deserve, but is even able to give us more than what we can ever think or imagine, these blessings will nevertheless not pale in comparison to the weight of our sacrifice.  When God rewards us, we can be sure that our rewards from Him will measure up to, if not outweigh the sacrifice we have made. </p><h1><strong>3)	Paul’s vindication of his spiritual authority (2 Cor. 10 – 13)</strong></h1><h1><strong>Sphere of Authority</strong></p><p><strong> </strong></h1><p>After addressing the necessary issues, Paul turns to reprimand the minority who did not heed his earlier warning to not walk in the flesh, but not before he reminded the people of his authority over them:</p><p><strong>“We, however, will not boast beyond measure, but within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us – a sphere which especially includes you” (2 Cor. 10:13)</strong></p><p>Paul recognised that God had appointed for him a sphere of authority, and that included the Corinth church, which was why he did not leave them to indulge in their sin, but took the pains to correct and reprove them.  An important principle to take note is grace and authority, which follow when we operate in the sphere of authority designated for us by the Lord.  This sphere of authority comprises of people (unbelievers and believers) God has placed in our social circle on which we are an influence.  We are accountable to God for this group of people, to the degree that He requires us to be.  Thus, it is important not to neglect this authority or to lay it aside, for God will require an account from us concerning the people in our sphere of authority (Eze. 33:6).  However, if we do not confine ourselves to working within the boundaries of the sphere of authority designated to us, we will soon find ourselves losing favour with men and with God when we attempt to operate in groups of people or areas where the Lord has not called us.</p><h1><strong>Blameless before the people (2 Cor. 11:8-9, 22-28)</strong></h1><p>Paul told the Corinthians that his conscience is clear as far as his dealings with them are concerned.  To prove his sincerity in ministering to the church, Paul gave no grounds for accusation.  He conducted himself in absolute boldness, which could only have come about because he kept his conscience immaculately clear before them.  Even in a time when he was in need, he refused to be a burden to them: <strong>“But we have been thoroughly manifested among you in all things.  …... And when I was present with you, and in need, I was a burden to no one, for what I lacked the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied.  And in everything I kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so I will keep myself.”  (2 Cor. 11:6,9)</strong></p><p>As witnesses of Christ (Acts 1:8), we should strive to ensure that our life and ministry are right before men, just as we aim to have a clear conscience before the Lord.  Paul was careful to always explain his actions to the church so as not to give place to any potential doubts that may arise as to his actions.  He was careful to avoid becoming a stumbling block to those whom he served.  In 2 Cor 8:16-21, Paul kept closed the door of opportunity for accusation from the church by taking the effort to give an account concerning the way he handled the gift offered to him.  Paul also added that even at a time when he was in need, never once was he found eliciting help from them (2 Cor 11:8-9).  The apostle had chosen to trust in God to provide and be without help rather than risk people having the impression that he is taking advantage of his authority amongst the Corinthians.  Accordingly, as Paul exercised faith in trusting God, provision was made for him, though not by the Corinthians but from the Macedonians.  What an assuring testimony to all!  When we do our part to keep our conscience clear before God and men, He fulfils the other side of the undertaking by giving us spiritual authority almost like what Jesus had, so that our ministry may bear out the power of God.  Let us, in the same way as Paul did, be mindful of the message that our lives convey and be blameless in the sight of men, giving no opportunity for accusation for the sake of the gospel. </p><h1><strong>Sincerity and love towards the church (2 Cor. 12:17-19)</strong></h1><p>Throughout Second Corinthians, Paul’s love for the Corinthian church was very evident as he uninhibitedly expressed his thoughts and feelings for them.  Very clearly, Paul did not take his service towards God’s people as a duty; he assumed it as a passion.</p><h1><strong>“what comes upon me daily:  my deep concern for all the churches.” (2 Cor. 11:28)</strong></h1><p>Paul’s love for the church was most self-sacrificial as he was willing and underwent much suffering without a reward or compensation from them in return.  He was ready to serve them at the expense of himself:  <strong>“And I will very gladly spend and be spent for your souls;” -</strong> even when he knows that was going to bring him more resentment from the church than appreciation:  <strong>“though the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.” (2 Cor. 12:15)</strong></p><p>He served, and continued to serve the Corinth church even at the pain of sufferance.  He served them until he was in need himself.  The Corinth church at that time did not meet his needs; nevertheless Paul continued to love them and serve them.  He never once neglected the Corinthians though they failed to provide for him when he was ministering there.  Whatever it was, Paul was set on doing whatever it took so that he may build the church in their faith:  <strong>“But we do all things, beloved, for your edification.” (2 Cor. 12:19)</strong></p><h1><strong>Warning to the remaining unrepentant minority (2 Cor. 12:20; 13:5)</strong></h1><p>In his final word to the Corinthians, Paul delivered a warning to the people who were still unrepentant of their ways even after hearing the words of his first letter to them in which Paul displayed disapproving feelings towards some of their attitudes and values.  He warned them that he was going to judge them when he saw them next: <strong>“This will be the third time I am coming to you.  “By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established.” (2 Cor. 13:1).  </strong>Knowing that they would not heed his correction, Paul left them to <strong>“examine themselves as to whether (they) are in the faith” (2 Cor. 13:5)</strong> and be accountable to God for themselves.</p><h1><strong>Spiritual Fathers and Spiritual Children</strong></h1><p>One of the major lessons we can take from the books of First and Second Corinthians is the relationship between a spiritual father and his spiritual children.  Paul, being a spiritual father to the Corinthian church, assumed that authority dutifully and accordingly demonstrated his role clearly by his love for them through rebuke, teaching and finally restoration. </p><p>Where God appoints a spiritual father-child relationship, such as between Paul and the Corinthian church, we must take that relationship seriously and give it due respect.  The Lord brings spiritual fathers into our lives to guide us in our spiritual walk, though these people may not have played a part in our spiritual conversion. </p><p>If we indeed recognise that God has placed someone over us whether for a season or for an extended period of time, then we have become a spiritual child to that person.  We ought then to be humble and submissive to receive as much as what God desires to channel through that vessel into our lives.  On several occasions, when a Christian is rebuked by his spiritual father, the spirit of pride surfaces and he turns away from the person in hurt, not realising that by doing so, they are allowing their hearts to be hardened.  The Corinthian church comprised of two groups of people – one, which responded positively, and the other, which spurned correction.  The ones who received Paul’s rebuke positively were commented in his latter letter, while those who took his remarks negatively were censured.  Learn to recognise the authority our Lord has placed in our lives so that indeed, we will not miss out on the blessing He intends which can only come about when we respond to that authority in humility and submissiveness.</p><p>Inasmuch as we encourage spiritual children to submit to the authority of their spiritual fathers, we wish to highlight the responsibility of a spiritual father, which is to be selfless in imparting whatever he possess to his spiritual children like how a natural father would not reserve anything from his children or deprive them of good things, generally speaking.  At some places, discipleship today has been sadly watered down to a routine study of the word, without an impartation of the life of God.  This leads us to see why the Body of Christ today lacks spiritual fathers.  It is because we lacked people who were willing to prepare people to reach beyond the potential they are at to rising above them.  As partakers of God’s holy kingdom, we should not be threatened by the persons we disciple but we should be prepared, just as Barnabas was, to raise up Paul(s) whom God has appointed to play more major roles in His kingdom.</p><p>It is imperative for us as Christians, to always be in a position of being a spiritual father to a younger Christian, as well as to be subject to a spiritual father to whom we are accountable. The extent of our willingness to be open to our spiritual fathers determines the amount of blessing we will receive from him.  Paul, in his many words of exhortation to the Corinthians, specifically urged them to be open to him just as he had been to them:</p><p><strong>“ O Corinthians!  We have spoken openly to you, our heart is wide open.  Now in return for the same (I speak as to children), you also be open.” (2 Cor. 6:11,13)</strong></p><p>The more we are at ease with our spiritual father, the more spiritual influence we receive from him.  At the same time, we need to remember that spiritual fathers are not perfect, and our attitude should hence be to glean the best and learn from the Lord’s dealings in their weaknesses.</p>
