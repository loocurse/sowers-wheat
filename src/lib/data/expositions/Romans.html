<h1><strong>Paul’s epistle to the  ROMANS</strong></h1><p>This issue deals with one of the several epistles of Apostle Paul - Romans.  The words and contents of this epistle are in themselves sound and highly evolved enough to silence any sceptic; but beyond that, beneath the black and white of Romans lies a remarkably refined and well-crafted delivery of Christian doctrine.  Romans is indeed a book that contains an invaluable exposition on Christian theology.  In their commendable pursuit of determining Christian truths and doctrine, several Bible scholars and theologians have, at almost every cogitation of a few verses or passages in Romans, faced puzzling difficulties that rose up to befuddle their understanding.  For our purposes, we will give interpreting the verses a miss and concentrate on the heart of the epistle instead.</p><h1><strong>Doctrinal:  How the gospel saves (Ch. 1 - 8)</strong></h1><p>Chapters 1 to 8 of Romans deal with the problem of sin and how one can be saved from the powers of sin.  Paul declares in Rom. 1:18 that “the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.”, which is to say that since his creation, Man has sinned against God and departed from His ways, and God being angered by this fall of humanity, is not withholding judgment but is going to hold us accountable for the things unacceptable in His sight.  The question we want to consider here is why.  Why, when He was well aware all along that we are but involuntary carriers of a sinful nature since birth did God in all His grace and lovingkindness not give a pardon, but is however going to judge us for our transgressions?  Do we see any justice here at all?  Any equity in such harsh dealings towards us?  Plenty of it!  God has all the reasons He needs to justify His punishing us for our transgressions!  “Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?” (Gen. 18:25).  Moses knew that God was always just, and Paul gave at least three reasons why we would deserve it when God judges even though we were born with a sinful nature and that not of our choice.</p><h1>1.	God has given us a general revelation of His existence, but it has been ignored</h1><p>The psalmist tells us that “the heavens are telling the glory of God; they are a marvellous display on his craftmanship.  Day and night they keep on telling about God.  Without a sound or word, silent in the skies, their message reaches out to all the world. (Psalm 19:1-4, Living Bible)”  This must then be why Paul said that “Since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, although they know God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were hardened. (Rom. 1:20-21)”  This was the basic truth of God’s existence and supremacy that was given to men, but we have “suppressed the truth in unrighteousness.” (Rom. 1:18).  Paul is saying that the environment we live in, our surroundings and the elements of Creation itself should tell us of the existence of a Creator, which would in turn point us to God!  Unfortunately, we have all sought the world’s pleasures and gone on our own ways instead of pursuing this initiation of revelation further until arriving at a knowledge of God which it would otherwise have led us to.  We have neglected the revelation that God had so graciously given to us!  In doing so, we have turned down the first invitation that God has extended to us that we may come to know Him.</p><p>After rejecting this light, men began on a steady downward pitch towards degeneration.  Our values are compromised, and our principles are cast like shadows behind us as we regress further from the revelation of God and godliness.</p><h1>2.	God made impressions on and convictions to the conscience - men have seared it.</h1><p>“their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them. (Rom. 2:14-15)”</p><p>Granted that no other one except those of the Jewish race have had the privilege of knowing God’s law and statutes, but we all have a conscience <em>within</em> ourselves to guide us, although that to a greater or lesser extent.  As part of creation, God has also made a moral instinct in each and every one of us - He has given us a conscience by which we <em>can</em> know or <em>should</em> be able to know the good from the bad, the right from the wrong.  However, even in this, we have failed God.  We have neglected this grace given to us; we choose not to heed, and we ignore, the tug at our conscience.  We yield instead to the yank of our desires.</p><p>Some of the members of the body of Christ have actually landed themselves in this stage without really realising it.  Just as how God “gave them up” who did not like to retain Him in their knowledge to degeneration and how He “gave them over” to a debased mind, God has no other course but to pass some people by who knew Him but yet did not choose to separate themselves from the world but continued a compromised lifestyle throughout.  The chastening of God is not to be taken lightly and He will not allow His grace to be taken for granted.  When chastisement is spurned and grace rejected, they withdraw from us and we are left for degeneration.  This is equivalent to self-destruction since we brought it upon ourselves in the very first place.  For though God loves us enough not to pronounce a curse on us when we reject the way, people are however punished by the consequences of their own sins (Rom. 1:24-32).  God spares us, but our actions themselves bring upon the curses on us, for the wages of sin is always death and we reap them when we reject the way of truth, which otherwise imparts the gift of eternal life to all who receives it.</p><p>On the Friday morning of 9 October last year, I received a word from the Lord concerning the people who have fallen into this category.  I remember the Spirit saying this:</p><p>“As from today, I will withhold my words from those who have hardened their hearts in pride and who have given themselves over to an attitude of self-confidence.</p><p>These people will receive no further counsel from me; they will call on Me but I will not answer.  Diligently, they will seek Me, but I will not be found by them.  For they have hated knowledge and have not chosen to fear the Lord, therefore having none of My counsel, they have despised My every rebuke.  They have reaped the fruit of their own way and they shall indeed eat it and be filled to the full with their own fancies (Prov. 1:28-31).  Now, this people shall keep on hearing but never understanding; they shall keep on seeing but without perceiving.” (Isa. 6:9)</p><p>My hand will dispense no more blessings to them, but with My finger I will take of those who have kept themselves away from this evil and who have yielded their hearts to Me.  Those who are poor in spirit, who never have enough of Me but who have committed themselves to depend wholly on God, these shall find Me.”</p><p>Dearly beloved of God, all who are loved by the Father, let us heed this exhortation now.  Come humbly before God.  We need to see and recognise our nakedness and bankruptcy without Him.  We need to acknowledge the need for us to depend on Him.  To those whom God have set apart from the flock, He will show the power of His deliverance and favour, but to those who have set themselves apart from Him and who have gone after the kingdom of the world, they shall surely live and undergo the same regimen hat has been appointed for the world.  They will have to suffer what has been stored up for the rest of the world who has rejected God.</p><h1>3.	The Jews have disobeyed the law (Rom. 2:17-24)</h1><p>God has entrusted the Jews with the noble task of carrying His law known to all other nations, but they have however fallen short of glory in this matter.  The law was intended to awaken their slumbering conscience and stir it up against sinfulness, but instead, the Jews rested on the law, led by the mistaken thought that because they were God’s chosen race to be a guide and standard to the morally and spiritually blind, they were therefore the just and righteous of creation.  They thought that they were immune and spared from God’s judgment.  It did not cross their minds to think that God would send a Jew to hell.  They were sharp to point at the transgressions of others, yet are unable to see the fault in themselves. So preoccupied were they with the activity of correcting others that our Jewish brothers have neglected the fact that they too are not immune to God’s judgment themselves.  As a result, they brought about more dishonour than honour to God when the Gentiles start shaming God each time they come across a Jew breaking the commandments of the Law.  This should remind us that at all times, we ought to be able to walk our talk and talk our walk at the same time.  Without that, we would be giving cause for people to impute shame on the name of the Lord like how the Jews caused blasphemy upon His name.  However, if our walk and talk agree and are consistent, the name of the Lord will be magnified in our lives.</p><p>What we have just read are the three reasons Paul gave as to why God would be justified in pronouncing judgment on us.  We have failed Him in all three areas, choosing to walk away from the light rather than towards it.  Remember our illustration in the previous issue (Gospel according to John) where we described a man who would walk so far away from the light to a point where total darkness envelopes?  This is just the kind of scenario Paul was describing in Rom. 1:24-32.  God will not strive with us forever (Gen. 6:3).  He will not always struggle with us to keep us in the light.  When we stiffen our necks and continue to walk away from the light He has given us,  God ‘gives up’ on us, and He let us go our way.  That is why three times Paul wrote that “God gave them up” (Rom. 1:24, 26, 28).</p><p>The verdict therefore is this: “there is none righteous, no, not one; for all have sinned and fallen shorten of the glory of God.” (Rom. 3:10; 23).  No doubts about it - men are incapable of saving themselves.  In the three ways that we cold probably gain some headway in redeeming ourselves, we have all failed God.  We have rejected the general revelation, ignored our conscience, and disobeyed His law.  We know now why Jesus in indeed “the Way, the Truth, and the Life. (John 14:6)”  The only answer for our redemption is Christ.  This is why Paul boldly proclaimed that he is not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God for salvation to all who comes to Him for it. (Rom. 1:16)</p><h1><strong>God’s redemption plan (Rom. 6:23; 5:8; 3:24-26)</strong></h1><p>“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 6:23).  Because of sin in our lives, we deserve death, but God, in all His goodness and mercy, has provided a way out for us to receive eternal life through His Son, Jesus Christ.  This was His unparalleled and marvellous love for us, and God demonstrated His love toward us by sending Jesus to die for us, not while we were pleasing Him in our ways, but while we were yet sinners!</p><p>“Being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God sent forth to be a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed. (Rom. 3:24-25)”</p><p>The word ‘justify’ means to reckon or declare to be righteous, and ‘propitiation’ means an acceptable sacrifice by which God’s wrath may be averted and be replaced by mercy instead.  The reason God can declare ungodly sinners to be righteous is only because Jesus Christ has paid in full the price of our sins, and He has done this by shedding His blood for us when He dies for us on the cross (1 John 2:2).  However, though Jesus Christ came to die for the whole world, not the whole world would be saved.  This is because only those who by faith accepts this sacrifice for their sins and put their faith in Him will merit salvation.  Our redemption in Christ can only be appropriated through faith and not through works (Rom. 4:2-5); we should imitate the faith of Abraham.  “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness. (Rom. 4:3)”</p><p>Until and unless we are being justified by faith in believing Him, we will be under the wrath of God.  However, being justified, we have peace with God (Rom. 5:1,9).  Having this assurance, we can now “come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Heb. 4:16)”  How privilege for us who have accepted Christ as the sacrifice for our sins!  Not only do we not have to bear the judgment we deserve, but beyond that, we can actually come all the way before His throne to draw grace from God whenever we need it!  This is therefore what we must learnt to do now.  We must continue, or start and get used to coming to God ourselves.  The Father’s good pleasure is to give us His kingdom (Lk. 12:32) and He loves to commune with us and give us the power beyond our natural ability to enable us to live a fulfilling and victorious life in His Son.  “Until now you have asked nothing in My name.  Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full. (John 16:24)”</p><h1><strong>Living a victorious Christian life (Rom. 6 - 8)</strong></h1><p>As earlier discussed, we realise that the law cannot save us, but rather it really works like a mirror in that it reflects, and the law reflects the ugliness of our sins.  For “…by the law is the knowledge of sin.” (Rom. 3:20).  If there is a spot or blemish on our face, looking into the mirror would reflect that.  However, continuing to stare no matter how intently into the mirror will by no means get that spot or blemish off our face!  Simply because the mirror was never designed to do that for us!  Likewise, the law is useful only to bring conviction to men when we sin.  When we bring our lives before the standard of the law, we realise how far we have fallen short of glory, but even if one were to gain the highest enlightenment on this, it can never save us from our sins.  The law was <em>not</em> designed to save us, but to show us that we need a savior.</p><p>Not only is the law incapable of bringing deliverance to mankind, but it has been used by the devil to bring out the evil in us.  “Sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desires. (Rom. 7:8)”  How true it is!  We are always more attracted to forbidden fruit than other fruits of the forest, more inclined to fishing in forbidden waters than in the common sea.</p><p>Very aptly, Paul puts it across to us:  “For what I will to do, that I do not practice; but what I hate that I do.  For the good that I will to do, I do not do; but the evil I will not to do, that I practice. (Rom. 7:15, 19)”  The more we desire and purpose to observe the law, the more we realise how full of sinful tendencies we are made up of and how impossible it is for any one of us to keep the entire law.</p><p>Surely such a struggle is not unfamiliar to us!  We struggle hard with ourselves sometimes, like Paul used to do.  Like Paul, we do the things that our conscience says no to, and we do not do the things we know we ought to be doing.  But before any of us go away with the thought that since even the apostle Paul had such a problem with sin, then surely God would not expect too much from us disciples in this area, let us take note that Paul did <em>not</em> resign himself to the fact that he was born with a sinful nature so to sin is natural for him and thus he should not feel too bad about it at all!  Instead, He showed us the way out.  He said we can overcome our self in three ways:  knowing, reckoning, and presenting.</p><h1>1.	Knowing</h1><p>“Know that as may of us were baptised into Christ Jesus we were baptised into His death. (Rom. 6:3)”  If we believe that the Lord Jesus has died for us and we accept that His death is our substitute, then we are united with the Lord in His death.  This means that as we believe in Christ, we are also being identified with Him in His death and resurrection.  This also goes to mean that positionally, we have died with Christ, though we may not have experienced it naturally/physically.  Earlier, we spoke of the degeneration of man when we chose to walk away from the light of revelation to the abyss of darkness; now Paul is talking about the regeneration of the spirit man.  When we unite with Christ by believing in Him, we reap the realisation of His resurrection life in our spirit (John 1:12-13).  For if we have been positionally crucified with Christ, then likewise, we have also been positionally raised up with Him.</p><p>“Knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. For he who has died is freed from sin.” (Rom. 6:6-7).  Positionally, we have died with Christ, for we have been “crucified” with Him.  We only need to know this as an accomplished fact (Rom. 6:11) and we can then experience liberty in spirit and deliverance from the power of sin (Rom. 6:14).  This is our liberation from sin, and we need to know and remember that it has already been done for us through the work of the cross, the death of Jesus Christ.</p><h1>2.	Reckoning (Rom. 6:11-12)</h1><p>“reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.”  To reckon means to actively consider and contemplate.  To consider what, and to contemplate on what?  Paul says, our co-death with Christ.  To accept that Christ has <em>died for us</em> is one thing; this is substitutionary death.  To reckon or to consider that we have <em>died with Him</em> is another thing.  This, we call co-death.  Do not be mistaken, we are not being morbid here, but we all need to realise that it is in death that new life is being released.</p><p>“I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh.  I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgments and do them.” (Eze. 36:26-27)</p><p>Jesus not only cleanse us from our sins but beyond that, He has given us a new heart and a new spirit (new nature) to enable us to love Him and to walk with Him.  Let us acknowledge this fact and walk in the light of this truth.</p><h1>3.	Presenting</h1><p>Having known the truth and accepted it, we should now proceed to the next stage, that is to present the truth in our daily lives.</p><p>Consider this illustration which may help in our understanding here:  A female child is abandoned at birth and lands up in a community that is made up of all male and no female.  She grows up in the company of boys and they are the only parties to interaction for her.  Naturally, this little girl would grow up accustomed to the ways of a man, adopting the demeanour and mannerisms of a man rather than that of a girl.  However, if a lady should come along and begin to show her the ways of a woman, how she should carry herself and how she ought to conduct herself, this girl would then be able to shed her manly ways and become womanly instead.  </p><p>This girl must first come to the knowledge that she is a different specie from the rest of her company (the boys).  With this, she must then reckon (actively consider) the rightful demeanour and conduct for a girl.  Only then will she be able to take on a feminine character and present herself as a girl.  Even then, it takes a willingness to change and a discipline to continue in her new ways in order for her to successfully lead a life as a girl.  Likewise for us who wants to live out the kind of victorious life the Bible talks about.  Formerly, when we were yet unsaved, we were used to being governed by our passions, and moved by our desires.  Our self takes pre-eminence in our lives.  The “spirit of man is the lamp of the Lord.” (Prov. 20:27).  Formerly, when we were walking in darkness, there was no light in the lamp.  But now, when we unite with Christ, God gives us the “new spirit” (Eze. 36:26) and lights up our “lamp” i.e. our spirit so that now we “walk by the Spirit, and do not gratify the desires of the flesh.” (Gal. 5:16).</p><p>Now that God’s life takes over, it does not however mean that our self will automatically take one step back in reverence and stop bothering us again.  It will indeed try and get into our way again, and we need to now deny the self and present ourselves as people living by the spirit of God and not by the lust of the flesh, for “as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” (Rom. 8:14).  We are to get into the practice of denying our self, making it a daily experience in our lives.</p><p>So far, we have been speaking of some practical issues that Paul had addressed in the early chapters of Romans.  We now come to consider some theological issues that have been raised in the next few chapters.</p><h1><strong>National:  How the gospel relates to Israel (Rom. 9 - 11)</strong></h1><p>We all know of God’s everlasting covenant made with Abraham with regards to the Jewish race.  How then is it that today Israel stands rejected by God while the Gentiles are being brought into the place of blessing meant for the Jews?</p><p>Again, before we even start deliberating on this, let us remember that God is good and just, and He will always do right (Gen. 18:25).</p><p>Paul remarked that “not all Israel are of Israel, not are they all children because they are seed of Abraham.” (Rom. 9:6-7).  In other words, though the Israelites are natural descendants of Abraham, they did not have Abraham’s faith and therefore they were not his spiritual children.  Just because a person is born into the nation of Israel does not mean that he is automatically an heir to the promises.  Now, if this was so of the Israelites, then how about the Christians?  Are all who under the rites to be recognised as Christians really Christians at all?  Jesus answers this question:</p><p>The Jews claimed their right before Jesus when they said to Him “We are Abraham’s descendants….” (John 8:32). Jesus, however, answered and said, “I know you are Abraham’s descendants……; (but) if you were Abraham’s children, you would do the works of Abraham.” (John 8:37,39).  Just because they were of Abraham’s lineage did not immediately grant them the promises that “Abraham’s descendants” are entitled to.  They had to prove their spiritual pedigree before they can inherit the blessings.  Likewise, Jesus said that “Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven.” (Matt. 7:21).  What then, we may ask, is considered doing the will of the Father in heaven?  The first and foremost step in doing God’s will is clearly revealed to us, that “… (we) believe in Him whom He sent.” (John 6:29).  To be a Christian in the Father’s eyes, we need to first believe in His Son, Jesus Christ.  Then, for one to be recognised as a Jew in His eyes, God must be able to see the same kind of belief and faith in that person which He saw was present in Abraham.  True faith will not fail to produce good fruit and good works (James 2:14-16).  God will not accept the people just because they claim to be of Israel, nor will He reject the true Israel who follows after Him.  Even then, this rejection will not endure always, but will cease once the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. (Rom. 11:25).  Let us go further to discuss the issue on election so that we may have a clearer understanding of the purpose of God.</p><p>“(for the children not yet being born, nor having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand,  not of works but of Him who calls), it was said to her, “The older shall serve the younger.”  As it is written, “Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.” (Rom. 9:11-13)</p><p>“For He says to Moses, “I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.” (Rom. 9:15)</p><p>“For the Scripture says to Pharoah, “Even for this same purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name might be declared in all the earth.”  Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.” (Rom. 9:17-18).</p><p>When we read the above passage, the verses might come across to some that God has chosen some on whom He would show His love and some unfortunate souls on whom He would pour His wrath on.  However, nothing of this can be further away from the truth.  It is not possible for us to grasp a complete understanding on God’s purposes and sovereignty here without going into the mechanics of theology itself, so we would just highlight some points which might give us a better understanding of this passage in Romans 9.</p><h1>a)	Preference for Jacob over Esau</h1><p>“The older shall serve the younger.”  As it is written, “Jacob I have loved, but Esau I have hated.” (Rom. 9:11-13)</p><p>God’s preference for Jacob is interpreted by most as an act of love, and in this light, His love for Esau would then seem inferior by comparison.  Objectively looking, God is not preferring Jacob over Esau, for if He created them both, then what merits would one of them over the other that God should love the one less than the other?  Like how God appointed the Jewish nation out of all the several other nations of the world to be His chosen race to carry His oracles and blessings to mankind, so God has also in His sovereignty chosen Jacob, as opposed to choosing you or me, or Esau to build the nation of Israel.  For His will in  Jacob’s life to accomplished, it would then seem appropriate that He gives more favour and grace to Jacob over Esau or even over anyone else for that matter.</p><h1>b)	Sparing some and sentencing the others</h1><p>As we have earlier discussed in chapters 1 to 5, every one of us is condemned by our unbelief and transgressions.  All are deserving of the penalty we incur, if it was ever to be imposed on us.  However, God, out of His sovereignty, may choose to use some of these people to show forth His grace and compassion.  Here, as to which one of us, either you or I, gets chosen to escape death sentence and receive a commission to be God’s chosen vessel to show forth His mercy does not depend on how much you have done or how long I have prayed all my life, but it vests solely in God’s sovereignty.</p><p>God is not unjust in that He punishes others more severely that some, but only that there are certain people whom though deserving of the same severity of judgment that others are receiving are chosen by God instead to bring a message across to His people.  We do not evaluate God on this, but we trust in His omnipotence in all His dealings.</p><h1>c.	The ‘victimisation’ of Pharoah</h1><p> Pharoah was known to all to be a wicked and stubborn King who refused to yield to the Lord’s will even after several attempts to make Him to do.  Sure, God could have easily removed Pharoah from the face of the earth like what He did to Herod (Acts 12:20-23), but He did not do that.  Instead, God preserved Pharoah’s life and allowed him to continue in his rebellion against Him so that He could in turn use the situation to demonstrate His power.</p><p>“For the Scripture says to Pharoah, “Even for this same purpose I have raised you up, that I might show My power in you, and that My name might be declared in all the earth.”  Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.” (Rom. 9:17-18).</p><p>The words “He hardens” would be more accurate if it were read “He allowed to harden.” instead.  Pharoah’s heart was hardened against God; God knew about it for the scriptures talked about it.  Granted, but this does not however mean that God was the one who put the ice in Pharoah’s heart!  Pharoah was bent on going against God; God knew it, and He allowed it though it did not please Him.  This was because God saw that the situation could be used as a ground for teaching the nations to nations to fear His name through the exercise of His power and might against the wiles of Pharoah.  His role therefore is permissive rather than pro-active because again, God is just and He never would be the author of evil.</p><p>Also, we remind ourselves that God is the beginning and the end.  He knows all things, in fact, it is more correct to say that He foreknows all things.  So, as far as God foreknows, He also predestines (Rom. 8:29).  Thus the basis on which the vessels and events of God’s predestination are chosen is based on His foreknowledge on that particular person or happening.  God’s sovereignty no doubt is absolute, but it is not and will never be exercised vindictively, for there is no unrighteousness with God, definitely not. (Rom. 9:14).</p><h1><strong>God’s rejection of Israel is not absolute </strong></h1><p>We all know that God, in His own sovereignty has chosen Israel to fulfill His eternal purpose. “For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.” (Rom. 11:29)  “I say then, has God cast away His people?  Certainly not!  Even so then, at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.”  (Rom. 11:1,5).</p><p>Spiritual blindness has come upon Israel, though by the mercies of God not all Israel is diseased with spiritual obscurity, but only the unbelieving ones.  That blindness, however,  is only temporal, and it will cease when the salvation of the Gentiles reaches its fullness.  (Rom. 11:25)</p><p>In Rom. 11:12, 15, we see that Israel was left aside when she rejected the gospel.  Then, the gospel began to go out to the Gentiles who received them with great zeal and fervour.  Having received the gospel, the Gentiles also experienced the goodness of God in their lives as Kingdom blessings began to flow in their community.  In this sense, the Gentiles’ blessings were consequential to Israel’s fall, and Israel’s loss was counted as the Gentiles’ gain.  Given this, just think of how much more of God’s blessings will the world receive if Israel were to be restored to her rightful place with God!  Indeed, the time when Israel turns to the Lord, she will become the channel of blessing to other nations.  This was illustrated in the life of Jonah, who we perceive to be a figure symbolic of Israel.  When Jonah was cast out of the boat during the storm, this resulted in a deliverance and salvation for the entire boat of Gentile riders.  Later, when Jonah was eventually restored and brought before Nineveh to preach repentance to them, the result was the entire city’s salvation!  Likewise, Israel’s rejection by God is only as temporal as Jonah’s time out in the waters.  Already, Gentiles are being brought into the kingdom of God every day!  What more when the time of rejection expires and the time comes for Israel to be restored?  When Israel gets back on her feet again, we can expect an influx of Gentiles in the kingdom of God!</p><p>Therefore, it is important to remember that we are but partaking of what rightly belongs to the Jews.  We should continue to stand in the gap to pray for their spiritual restoration.  Being a “wild olive tree” grafted into the portion of privilege and favour, it is not appropriate for us to boast of any superiority over our Jewish brothers.  We need to remain sober always and remember that we are merely being allowed to pick up what some one has thrown away or dropped.  So, having discovered the goodness of God in that He allowed the blessings for Israel to overflow into the Gentile community, it is vital for us now to consider the contrasting facet of God’s character in this lesson - His severity.  If God had no reservations about cutting off the natural branches from the Vine, surely there is no reason for us to believe that He would spare the wild olive branches that do not bear fruit! (Rom. 11:20-22).  When God did not spare Israel from rejection when she turned from the way, then we need to be careful that we do not take the grace for granted, for He too, will not spare us.</p><h1><strong>Practical:  The bearing of the gospel on our conduct (Rom. 12 - 16)</strong></h1><p>In the four concluding chapters, Paul gives us the practical application of the gospel that pertains to our lifestyle and behavior.  These are God’s standards as regards our principles, values and relations which we would present under the following three genera:</p><h1>a)	Service and love to others (Romans 12)</h1><p>A solemn and devout meditation of the mercies of God as they are presented to us in chapters 1 to 11 lead only to one conclusion, that we need to present our bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God.  Total commitment is only our reasonable service. (Rom. 12:1-2)</p><p>In Rom. 12:3-8, we are exhorted to serve on  another humbly with our spiritual gifts.  We should never exaggerate our own importance neither should we be envious of the others who experience a greater manifestation of the spiritual gifts I his or her life.  Rather, we should realise that each person is unique and that we all have an important function to perform in our service for the Lord.</p><p>Next, Paul lists some characteristics that every believer should develop in his dealings with other Christians and with the unconverted.  The key is to walk in love.  </p><h1>b)	Submission to authorities (Romans 13)</h1><p>“Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities.  For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God.” (Rom. 13:1)</p><p>No government exists apart from God’s will.  This does not mean that God approves of all that human governors do.  It is helpful to remember that Paul wrote this letter during the reign of the infamous Nero who was emperor of the Roman empire in those days.  Those were one of the darkest days for Christians, for Nero blamed the Christians for a fire which destroyed half the city of Rome and some believers were even immersed in tar before they were then ignited with fire to be human torches!  Others were thrown to ravenous dogs and lions for food!  Yet, Paul wrote that “whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.” (Rom. 13:2)  When God makes Himself the avenger of souls, we believe He expects us to steadfastly trust in Him and not strive with the opposition.</p><p>The only exception to God’s command for us to obey the authorities is when the observance calls for a compromise on our faith and loyalty to Christ. (Acts 5:29).  We therefore are to decide for ourselves the times when we must by obeying God incur the wrath of men.  In such circumstances we must then hold fast our faith and endure the ordeal even if it means to the point of death.  For if we profess to live our lives for Christ, then why should we hesitate to give up our lives any time it is required of us since it never belonged to us in the first place?</p><h1>c)	Mutual consideration for one another (Romans 14 - 16)</h1><p>These couple of chapters deals with issues that are incidental, which though not of real fundamental importance, are however, necessary so that we not misrepresent the attributes of God in our relations with people.  These are minor details that often spark conflicts amongst people and even amongst the brotherhood of believers.  The following principles, if used to guard our common conduct, might  help us avoid some of these abrasions:</p><ul><li>accept the frailty of a young or weak Christian’s faith and do not engage him in disputes over non-essentials (Rom. 14:1);</li><li>exercise forbearance in our dealings with one another.  A more mature Christian should not despise the weakness of a younger one (Rom. 14:3; 15:1);</li><li>put out all tendencies to judge one another.  Watch that we do not say or do anything that would distract or hinder another person’s spiritual progress (Rom. 14:13);</li><li>do not abuse Christian liberty by selfishly enforcing our rights, but deal with the weaker members kindly, being considerate towards them.  Make also allowance for their excessive scruples (Rom. 14:22; Rom. 15:1)</li></ul><p>These are principles we ought to observe in our dealings with people around us.  That we do not seek to satisfy our own pleasure at the expense of ruffling another’s cool.  However, we must remember that these principles apply only to matters that are negligible; they are not to be applied in cases where fundamentals are involved.  For in such cases, one cannot afford to compromise, but should rightly present the truth to the errant brother.  Otherwise, we conduct ourselves in a manner promoting peace and amity, with all joy in the Holy Spirit. (Rom. 14:17).</p><p>With this, Paul ends his letter with personal greetings, with a benediction and doxology in conclusion.</p>
