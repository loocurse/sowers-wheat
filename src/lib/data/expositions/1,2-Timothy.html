<h1><strong>FIRST AND SECOND TIMOTHY</strong></h1><p>As soon as Paul dedicated himself to the Lord’s ministry, his life became fraught with much persecution and trials.  For preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ, Paul was rejected by people, thrown into jail, and even beaten up.  Nonetheless, not beset by the persecutions, Paul perseveringly stood to the end, with his faith right beside.  For all the beatings that he’d received, and the sufferings experienced in jail, Paul was unflinching and he never gave up loving and serving the Lord.  He continued making missionary journeys to the places God called him to, and in those places, faithfully and fearlessly proclaimed and demonstrated the Word and power of God. The letters of First Timothy together with Titus, have been believed to have been written over Paul’s fourth missionary journey, after his release from the Roman imprisonment (Acts 28:16, 30).  Shortly after that release, Paul suffered a second imprisonment when he was taken captive again.  It was then that he wrote the letters that make up Second Timothy.</p><p>First and Second Timothy were written by Paul to Timothy with a three-fold purpose in mind.  The first of these was to instruct Timothy on shepherding the church in Ephesus, the second to develop the charge committed to Timothy, and finally an exhortation to Timothy concerning displaying unswerving boldness in transmitting the gospel despite the assail of hardships.</p><p>As prophesied in Haggai 2:9, the Lord’s will was for the glory of the latter temple to be greater than that of the former.  Clearly, His desire then must be for us to be a generation that would reflect His glory in an even greater splendour than what the earlier generation contained.  From the exploration of these two books, we hope to be able to position ourselves to experience the fulfilment of the prophecy.</p><p>For the church to continue in glory, or indeed, to be even more outstanding in power, we need people in the manner of Paul.  They would not retract in the face of adversity, and they would make diligent investments in personal discipleship.  While he served God appreciably in the public platform before the multitudes, Paul was wise enough to reckon that a private ministry to a disciple was just as crucial.  </p><p>It is not a painless way to go, though.  Few of us come to the table of spiritual leadership having learnt all these lessons about loving God single-heartedly and serving His desires towards His people, fervently.  Integrity of heart and conduct towards people, and indeed, towards God Himself, need to be developed in a person who wants to give his life to the service of the kingdom of God.  This usually takes place over time, with God enabling, and the person yielding.  It is an important preliminary stage before assuming a high command of leadership, because we have heard and seen too many unfortunate cases of ministers thriving in their public ministry, but leaving their private ministry hollow.  With the way the modern church is progressing (advancing at an accelerated pace now), it has become increasingly common for ministers to be so absorbed in the daily demands of public ministry that they inadvertently neglect their mentoring relationship with those whom they have committed to guide and lead in the way of discipleship.  This is further complicated by the unspoken draw that public ministry holds by their naturally more resulting recognition and rewards.  Generally, results from public ministry go far beyond that from private ministry.  Promising more forthcoming rewards, ministry to the multitudes is usually more favoured, and the generous amount of effort and attention assigned there often result in a compromised service on the side of private discipleship.  </p><p>While the Lord Jesus remained accountable to God’s redemption plan for the whole of human race, He did not neglect His ministry with His twelve disciples.  Apart from His ministry to the crowds, Jesus placed significant emphasis on His private ministry to them, giving particular attention given to those whom He knew God the Father has given Him.</p><p>The Great Commission is really as much about continuing the impartation of God into the lives of younger Christians through discipleship as it is about salvation.  Experienced leaders will know that while the call to public ministry has to be served, it is crucial that the task of imparting the anointing to another chosen person or persons who will bear the mantle after the time comes for them to lay it down, is also being attended.  This will then bring about a perpetuation in ministry.  Then, if the recipient (the one being mentored) would be faithful to further mature and develop the anointing he receives from his mentor, the anointing in him will gain muscle before it is imparted to another person.  Keeping up this pattern will mean that the anointing gains strength and power with each subsequent impartation i.e. “it gets better each time”.  We can then imagine how strong a Body of people the Church of Christ can be!  So, it is not going to take you very far to bring the Church from glory to glory, because by attending diligently to what you have, you are sharpening a powerful instrument that will propel the fulfilment of that prophecy. </p><p>In that ideal situation, there is yet another constant that has to be there before the equation works itself out to the desired result.  To hammer out a ‘Paul &amp; Timothy’ kind of relationship that will carry on a ministry, we will need, not just ‘Paul’ but ‘Timothy’ too!  Even with faithful men and women who are wise and responsible mentors, there must also be disciples in the likes of Timothy who would heed the charge of their mentors.   ‘Timothys’ (the 2<sup>nd</sup> generation to continue what God has initiated) has to learn to heed the charge of mentors seriously.   Spiritual mentors can only impact so much of a person’s life as the latter heeds his guidance.  To have a strong group of people that will take the glory of the church to a higher dimension, we do need a group of ‘Pauls’ who are willing to disciple, but there must also be a group of ‘Timothys’ who are willing to  humble themselves and incline their hearts to the counsel from their spiritual mentors and allow themselves to be guided in the way that leads them to carry out the callings of God.  </p><p>Even then, when we have both ‘Pauls’ as well as ‘Timothy’, we will still need another condition before the Church of Christ measures higher heights in faith and glory.  There need to be a genuine spiritual hunger for the things of God, which unfortunately, is a rarity these days. Elisha, <em>hungered</em> for his mentor’s anointing – he asked God, not just for Elijah’s anointing to be imparted to him, but for a <em>double</em> portion of it.  He wanted it so that he might serve God in no lesser glory than what Elijah rendered.  In comparison, the person Elisha mentored, Gehazi, who was potential successor to his ministry, had not what it required to carry on a successful ministry given to him.  He had hungered after spiritual power not to glorify God or serve His people, but because he lusted after worldly riches and material possessions.  He saw spiritual power as a catalyst to gaining those things, and it wasn’t long before Gehazi lost the glory of the ministry to ignoble pursuits.</p><p>Some of you reading this might be the ‘Paul’(s) that God has called, while others of you might be the ‘Timothy’(s) He has called.  Whoever, we encourage you to lay hold of that.  Rise up to God’s challenge if He requires, take the charge and guard it diligently if you know you are the one it was meant for.  Then we can all work towards the Church that God, by His grace and calling, has prepared us to be.</p><h2>CHARGE regarding the purity of doctrine </h2><p><strong>“Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Tim.2:14-15)</strong></p><p>Paul reminded Timothy that he was to be well-appointed concerning the Word of God.  That was needed because with the potential likelihood of doctrinal disputes that might arise from inadequate comprehension or instruction, Timothy had to indoctrinate himself in the Word so as to provide a clear point of reference in those circumstances.  Also, a leader who is of sound standing in the Word will discourage woolly discussions about the Word and will be a sure guard against uncontrolled spreading of false doctrine in the church.</p><p>Unless directed by the Holy Spirit otherwise, the preaching of God’s Word to His people must generally satisfy two conditions, that is, they must be 1) a source of godly exhortation and teaching to their hearers and, 2) a channel through which faith is imparted from the pulpit to the pews.  To say it another way, the rule of thumb is to always draw attention back to the emphasis on the essentials of God’s Word and avoid disputes over it other than when it is needed so as to establish a material point. </p><p><strong>“Charge some that they teach no other doctrine, nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith” (1 Tim.1:4).</strong></p><p>The next thing we want to consider is how we can bring the ministry of the Word to a higher dimension in our generation.  Revelation is progressively given - we, the latter generation should therefore experience a greater level of revelation than the generation before us.  Let’s consider this, <strong>“I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your testimonies are my meditation. I understand more than the ancients, because I keep your precepts.”</strong> <strong>(Ps. 119:99-100).</strong> <strong> </strong>It is marvellous to know that it is possible to gain understanding beyond that of our teachers or ancients.  The key to it is very simple - meditation.  Jesus promised that <strong>“when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide (us) into all truth…” (Jn.16:13).  </strong></p><p>This work of the Holy Spirit, however, will need to be girded by meditation.   Without this part of us taking the responsibility to meditate on the truth, just reading the Word will not bring about the kind of revelation that will enlighten and transform, us.  May we all aspire to bring the ministry of the Word into greater glory in our generation till <strong>“the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea” (Hab.2:14).</strong></p><h1><strong>Charge regarding warfare </strong></h1><p><strong>“This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare…”(1 Tim.1:18)</strong></p><p><strong>“Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate on these things; give yourselves entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all” (1 Tim.4:14-15).</strong></p><p>Paul further charged Timothy to use what had been prophesied concerning him to gain a victorious stance in spiritual warfare and to chart his spiritual progress.  This is because prophecy inspired by the Holy Spirit administered through the Lord’s chosen vessel is also a component of God’s Word.  Therefore, like the written Word of God (the Bible), the spoken Word of God (prophecies) can be wielded as the “sword of the Spirit” (Eph. 6: 17) in spiritual battles.  </p><p>Whenever God reveals His plans (in this case, the form of prophecy over our lives), Satan will always contend them.  We need to do something for what God had deposited (by His spoken Word) into us.  By laying hold of them, we are guarding and protecting our destiny in God.  Since prophecies are likely to contain confirmation of the call of God upon our lives (among other things), laying hold of them is a good defence against the devil trying to steal, kill, and destroy our destiny (John 10:10).</p><p>On the side, we want to add that while it is important to pay serious heed to prophecies made concerning us, we do not need to ham it up by taking all conceivable steps to fulfil them.  Just being consciously aware of them whilst maintaining a connection with God is enough, because when God releases the mouths of His chosen ones to prophecy, He will despatch grace and provision for the fulfilment.  God does <em>not</em> make empty words.  Do not try to ‘self-fulfil’ your prophecy, you  can be engineering it by the flesh.</p><p>In Mk.4:35, Jesus said to His disciples <strong>“Let us cross over to the other side.”  </strong>God just spoke there, through Jesus.  He is saying He will take Jesus and His disciples to the other side of the waters.  Then came the tumultuous windstorm that almost rocked the disciples out of their faith.  They became fearful and began to tell Jesus to save them for they were afraid to die.  Instead of doing something to bring them towards the promise of God, they spend the time worrying about dying before they get to where God said He would take them.  But are we not the same?  Don’t many of us fear the possibility of dying even before we get to fulfil God’s calling for us?  Yet all we do in the meantime is worry that the possibility seems more real with each passing day, without taking any constructive action to correct it. </p><p>Jesus said to them <strong>“Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?” (Mk.4:40)  </strong>Is Jesus expecting them to rebuke away the wind and sea as He did?  Can they do that? Based on what?  </p><p>They can, and they ought to have, based on the single ground that God has spoken, therefore whatever that stands in the way could and must be removed by faith.  This is how we engage the words of prophecy in warfare.  If the Lord has spoken callings and destinies for us, then He will substantiate them with provision and grace more than sufficient.  What we then need to do is summed up in this: <strong>“Believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper” (2 Chron.20:20).</strong></p><h1><strong>Charge regarding conduct towards the fellowship of believers </strong></h1><p><strong>“Do not rebuke an older man, but exhort him as a father, the younger men as brothers, the older women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with all purity.” (1 Tim. 5:1-2)</strong></p><p>In this institutionalised relationship within the church, Paul’s instructions to Timothy were straightforward: be respectful towards the elder generation and be an example for the younger ones.  </p><p>Paul was of the opinion that as a matter of propriety, Timothy, as one in high spiritual authority in the church, should refrain from rebuking an older man.  This is of course not the same as telling Timothy to excuse or minimise whatever misconduct of senior citizens of the church.  What Paul intended was that Timothy should “exhort” them, which is to correct them in a gentle and humble manner.  Even in circumstances where it might be justified, we are not to act parental or one-up over an older person or display spiritual superiority over them.  </p><p>To the rest, familiar proprietary codes apply.  To the younger members, be an exemplary figure, in all aspects possible.  Regard younger men as brothers and pay special care in conduct towards the women folk.  Older women should be highly respected and younger women should be honoured with circumspect.  In caring for widows, Paul gave instructions to distinguish their needs accordingly, so that the church does not end up using resources to support those who are well able to work for a living (1 Tim. 5:3-16).</p><h1><strong>Charge regarding the treatment of God’s servants </strong></h1><p><strong>“Let the elders who rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially those who labour in the word and doctrine. For the scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain,” and, “The labourer is worthy of his wages.” (1 Tim.5:17-18)</strong></p><p>Taking care of the sheep means making sure the shepherds are well cared-for.  When the shepherds are doing well, they can pay more attention to tending the flock.  Conversely, when the shepherds are stagger in lack, how much can they do for the flock?  Of course, this is one way of saying that if in a position to determine anything, we should ensure that we do not underpay church workers.  However, the Word of God gives similar directions too, so it is no longer an issue of whether what is a better way to do things, but more importantly, whether we are obeying divine orders.</p><p>The word of God tells us that the ox treading the field should not be muzzled.  We cannot see what else that could possibly mean other than saying that a full-time worker of God should be entitled to partake of the fruit of his labour by being sufficiently provided for.  In the Old Testament, all eleven other tribes were commanded to give their tithes to the tribe of Levi who were serving the Lord’s ministry, so that they could focus their concentration on serving God without being distracted by issues of finances.  If God cared enough for His workers in those days, now that we behold a better glory and a better ministry, wouldn’t He be as concerned that His workers are well taken cared of too?  </p><p>The elders of today’s church, who fulfil the functional roles of the Levites, should be sufficiently  taken care of and not be in lack so  that they too can give their hearts to serving wholeheartedly.</p><p>On another note, Paul also expects a higher code of conduct from God’s servants.  They are to display integrity of actions and conduct themselves respectably above reproach. Therefore, Paul instructed that if anyone was to persistently live contrary to whatever is right, then consequences shall be put to him.  He clearly instructs Timothy, as the overseer of the church, to rebuke an elder who <strong>“is sinning”</strong>, and Timothy must do that <strong>“in the presence of all”</strong>.  To correct any misinterpretation here, Paul is not saying that each time an elder sins, he ought to be rebuked publicly.  No, the description used was<strong> “is sinning”</strong> which means that the person actually carries a practice of sinful conduct or living for an extended period of time.  It is not an isolated act as a result of a momentary weakness of the flesh that warrants such severe penalty.  But if an elder, being a person appointed to be a spiritual authority in the church does not conduct himself as he should but indulges in a pattern of sinful living, then correction must be made, and the errant person will have to bear the disciplinary measures proportionate to his wrongful conduct.  This is because it is expected of someone who has been appointed to such a high and visible level of service to all the more be watchful of his own conduct because of the extent of influence he has over the members of the church.</p><p>Some may wonder why such a somewhat harsh and unnecessary treatment of church leaders.  Is it not sufficient to simply confront the elder in private and spare him from public embarrassment?  Perhaps some people are better off with that, but leniency that has been commonly practised, out of consideration for the sinning elder, has given rise to an inherent lack of the fear of God among many Christians today.  Therefore we feel inclined to agree with the strict ruling to maintain a righteous stance against misconduct of ministry members within the church.  That will certainly involve some pain for the person being corrected, but <strong>“no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it” (Heb. 12:11).</strong></p><p>Brothers and sisters, do not forget that God's ways are higher than ours.  Let us never replace the wisdom of God on how to handle a situation with our own.  We can never be more gracious than our loving Father towards His children. </p><h1><strong>Charge regarding conduct in working relationships </strong></h1><p><strong>“Christian slaves should work hard for their owners and respect them, never let it be said that Christ’s people are poor workers. Don’t let the name of God or his teaching be laughed at because of this. If their owner is a Christian, that is no excuse for slowing down; rather they should work all the harder because a brother in the faith is being helped by their efforts.” </strong></p><h1><strong>(1 Tim. 6:1-2) T.L.B</strong></h1><p>Concerning the attitude a worker should have towards his employer at work, Paul taught that serving them to the best of our ability in a way that allows us to be responsible in other aspects of life is to be practised.  This is because, for the non-believing master who sees such excellence of spirit in a Christian worker, the name of God will be honoured.  As for the believing master, it becomes a way God is exhibiting love and blessing to him through the professional benefits his worker brings him.  The guiding principle therefore is that in whatever any believer does at the lay ministry, it should not cause the name of God to suffer disgrace or contempt from those who watch them.</p><h1><strong>Charge regarding prayer life</strong></h1><p><strong>“Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence…” (1 Tim. 2:1- 4)</strong></p><p>Timothy was also taught to spread the practice of prayer throughout the church.  God desires men to pray for one another, especially for those in authority so that the church continues to enjoy peaceful times where worship and service unto God do not come under restriction by governing authorities. </p><p>Further, count it as a privilege to be able to stand before God and intercede for people.  It used to be the duty and obligation of priests, and now that we have been made part of a royal priesthood in the Lord, the duty flows to us and we ought to be praying for our brothers and sisters.</p><h1><strong>Charge regarding women</strong></h1><p><strong>“women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and moderation, not with braided hair or gold or pearls or costly clothing, but, which is proper for women professing godliness, with good works” </strong></p><h1><strong>(1 Tim. 2: 9 - 10).</strong></h1><p>Paul instructed that women should dress with ‘propriety’ and ‘moderation’, avoiding ‘costly clothing’.  Propriety in this area of clothing oneself means avoiding anything that would invite shame unto oneself.  It carries the idea of being modest and discreet.  Moderation would mean that we do not overdress ourselves (after all the church is hardly a place for anyone to be showing their prized designers suits or most valuable accessory), but neither do we under dress. </p><p>While we don’t want to sound like prudes expecting womenfolk to roam about in church dressed up like priestesses, it is really more of a disturbing distraction than an alluring attraction, for women to be wearing clothes that look as though they were exhibiting their figures.  Like Paul, we would recommend decent fashions that do not look as if cloth were a rare commodity these days e.g scanty clothes.  It is difficult for anyone, when they see (literally in this case) so much of the ‘flesh’ you display, to see the Christ in you.  May no one be deceived here, and everyone gain the wisdom of God in bearing an acceptable testimony of His glory and meekness even in the area of dressing.</p><h3><strong>Liberation from curse</strong></h3><p>One of the immediate consequences of man’s sin was the pronouncement of a curse.  From the time when Eve sinned, the curse of childbearing pangs came upon the women race. For ages, women have suffered the effects of the curse and childbearing pains have been known as one of the most intense humans have ever experienced.  </p><p>In his words to Timothy, however, Paul proclaimed that women could be delivered from that curse. When Christ came to set us free, we have been liberated, not only from the curse of the law, but also from whatever curses that have been pronounced before the shedding of the redeeming blood of Christ.  Man was cursed with earning his living in toil and sweat, but that had been removed by the death and resurrection of Christ – today we are promised that all we need is to seek first the kingdom of God with the promise that our material needs will be met. </p><p>Being enlightened in our spiritual senses to this truth enables one to receive and materialise the promises of God.  On the other hand, being ignorant of the truth about relief from curses and release into blessings will keep one out of the redemption grounds of God’s divine promises.  My own family experienced the relief from the curse of childbearing pain when our daughter was born to us.  Those who desire to grow more knowledge of this truth , we recommend reading the book ‘Supernatural Childbirth’ by Jackie Mize.</p><h1><strong>Charge regarding godliness</strong></h1><p><strong>“But reject profane and old wives’ fables, and exercise yourself rather to godliness” (1 Tim. 4: 7)</strong></p><p>Godliness is identifying with the likeness of God: cultivating the qualities of His character in our lives; or inclining our minds to take after that of Christ’s etc.  The words <strong>`exercise yourself toward godliness' (1 Tim. 4:7)</strong> tells us plainly that godliness is something we can achieve . We can give up the wishful thinking that we can breezily drift towards godliness.  If godliness is something that will be rewarded at the end of the day, then we’ve got to exercise ourselves for it. We should continue to yield ourselves to God and appropriate His Grace daily into godliness. </p><p>Godliness does not merely reap for us benefits in the realm of eternity, but for this life as well<strong> “godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come”(1 Tim. 4:8)</strong>.  We can’t name you all of the benefits you can possibly gain out of a godly lifestyle, for you’ve got to experience it to know it.  All we can assure you is that God is no blinking liar – if He promised you good things that will come out of godliness, you can count on His word.</p><p>Having said that, Paul quickly adds that godliness without contentment can be great pain.  Though godliness will certainly reap benefits in this life, but because earth is not heaven where conditions are perfect, choosing to lead a godly life in Christ is not a guarantee of total bliss and without implications.  </p><p>When a man says yes to something, he is saying no to another.  Therefore, by saying yes to things that pertain to godly living, we are saying no to things that will distract us from it, so this will inevitably involve some degree of sacrifice on other aspects of life.   This may cause you to lose certain pleasures or even luxuries in life, and if you aren’t content with what God has already given you, but are always looking for more to add to your material collection, then almost as soon as you start practising godliness, you will find yourself missing those things (because you have not been contented) and will end up more miserable than the one leading the more compromising life.  It is not possible to have our eyes fixed on the things of the world and the things of God together.  </p><p>On the other hand, contentment without godliness can cause one to drift into laziness.  The person who is so overwhelmingly contented with knowing God’s will and inheritance stored up for him that he doesn’t practise godliness and move towards reaching for them will end up miserable as well, because the riches are not going to belong to him if he doesn’t go out to get them anyway!  Just fixing your eyes on the rewards and feeling contented at the magnificence of them will not bring them to you.  So, be grateful and give thanks to God for what He can do for you, but don’t forget to pursue your relationship with Him.</p><h1><strong>Charge regarding appointment of Ministry Workers</strong></h1><p><strong>“I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing with partiality. Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people’s sins; keep yourself pure.” (1 Tim. 5: 21- 22)</strong></p><p>Where it comes to appointing church workers, the word of God lays down a strict criterion. As human beings, we tend to be prejudiced against a person's suitability simply because his or her styles or ideas of doing things do not coincide with ours.  Or we at times appoint an unsuitable person for ministry work by allowing our judgement to be clouded by the high social standing of the candidate.  When bad decisions are made regarding choices of persons for ministry work, the result is predictable: poor quality of service unto God and His people.  Concerning this, we are of the stand that in the same way that a supervisor will be held vicariously liable for the mistake of his subordinate in the corporate context, so the church leader (who is accountable for the members) shares in God’s rebuke of the worker he has wrongly appointed.  The responsibility of blame will have to be shared between both sides.  Paul warns Timothy, therefore, to be extremely selective in and never to appoint a person hastily.</p><p>When Peter and the apostles asked the multitudes to select from among them seven men to serve in the Lord’s ministry, they did not immediately confirm their appointment, but only <strong>“when they had prayed, they laid hands on them” (Act 6:6).</strong></p><h3><strong>Charge regarding the Word</strong></h3><p><strong>“Remind them of these things, charging them before the Lord not to strive about words to no profit, to the ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” (2 Tim.2:15)</strong></p><p>At the general level of believers in the church, Paul charges Timothy to remind everyone that they should refrain from unprofitable discussions and controversies as far as God’s word is concerned, since such talk does nothing to build up, but only lead to more disquietening among the hearers of them.  Paul then charges Timothy also to study the Word of God so that he will know the truth in God’s word and before the church he need not be ashamed when questions concerning God’s word are brought to him.</p><h1> </h1><p>This is thus the same standard that is required of today’s church leaders as well, that you be able to enlighten people on the truth in God’s word.  If you are a leader among God’s people, then you are required to be equipped with God’s word at all times, so that you would be ready<strong> “in season and out of season” (2 Tim. 4:2).</strong>  </p><p>Paul, even when he was in prison, knowing that he was about to die, continued studying (2 Tim 4:13) the word of God.  Whether called to teach or not, the foundation is still to be built on God’s Word. The full counsel of God is ultimately the foundation on which to build our calling. Timothy, though called to be an evangelist, was specifically reminded not to forsake diligence in the word.</p><h1><strong>Guard against great Apostasy</strong> </h1><p><strong>“Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons…” (1 Tim. 4:1)</strong></p><p><strong>“For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. But be watchful in all things…” (2 Tim.4:1- 5)</strong></p><p>Timothy was warned to guard against the great apostacy that will see the hearts of many men turn cold and hard against God.  It will be a time of great deception when many men will prefer to hear whatever supports their lifestyles and values over the truth that may be directed at them in a way they don’t like.  Thus, Timothy was urged to indoctrinate the people in godly truths and principles while their hearts are still tender, so that at the time of the great apostasy, they might not be so easily swayed and less hearts will turn from truth.</p><h1><strong>Guard the gifts deposited in his life</strong></h1><p><strong>“Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery. Meditate on these things; give yourselves entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all.” (1 Tim.4: 14- 15)</strong></p><p><strong>“Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands.” (2 Tim.1:6)</strong></p><p>The above verses highlight an important spiritual principle.  By the laying on of hands, spiritual gifts can be imparted to another and deposited in him.  It therefore becomes one way that the calling of God can be accelerated in a person’s life, through the enabling of that person’s spiritual capacity through the impartation of spiritual anointing.  </p><p>Please do not misunderstand, however, that the grace and anointing of God can be controlled by the laying of hands of one on another.  They can’t – they can only be imparted as He wills.  When Moses laid his hands on Joshua, only the gift of wisdom was imparted; and though Moses was also a prophet, the mantle and gift of prophecy however did not automatically flow from him to Joshua (Deut. 34:9). </p><p>Also, the measure of the capacity to which that anointing is stretched in the person who received it will depend on how responsibly the person receives and guards the anointing. Though there were others besides him who were called to be apostles, Paul said that <strong>`By the grace of God, I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all” (1 Cor. 15:10).  </strong>Taking hold of prophecies and God’s calling upon your life, and guarding them seriously in prayer and meditation are as important as working to fulfil them.  Distractions will be less successful with you and you are more likely to fulfil your calling within the time designated because you would be more focused and less distracted along the way.</p><h1><strong>Guarding our testimony</strong> </h1><h1><strong>“Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord…” (2 Tim. 1:8)</strong></h1><p><strong>“Fight the good fight of faith…confessed the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. (1 Tim.6:12)</strong></p><p>Timothy was also told to guard the way the testimony of his life is working out, for it is important that we live up to our confessions and what we profess as the truth and faith in Jesus Christ.</p><p>God desires that we worship Him in spirit and in truth.  Mere confession of our faith and no matter how enthusiastically we talk or sing about our faith will not achieve anything for us or for the motivation of anyone else if they are not accompanied by a life that mirrors them.  God will not accept sacrifices of lips without the living sacrifice of men. Our testimony many a times preaches a more powerful gospel than our most rehearsed sermon.  It is the testimony of our life in Christ that gives us the authority in our ministry.  Where there is lack of testimony, it is usually followed by a lack of effective ministry.</p><h1><strong>Guard the faithfulness in times of hardship</strong> </h1><h1><strong>“You therefore must endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.” </strong></h1><h1><strong>(2 Tim. 2:3)</strong></h1><p>Timothy was told to guard himself against falling away in difficult times.  As a soldier of Christ, he was told to endure hardships and persevere on towards the upward call in Christ.  </p><p><strong>“.. all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.” (2 Tim 3:12)</strong></p><p>There is no exception to that found in the scriptures, so unless God made special concession for you, the general order of things is that those who choose to follow the Lord will not be spared from the devil’s rod.  That is not meant to depress you, but to warn so that you will not be surprised when it happens.  Do not cower in fear when the time comes when your faith is challenged.  Timothy was reminded not to fear men, but to look toward the Lord for all things (2 Tim. 1:8-12).</p><h1><strong>Guard against perilous times and perilous men</strong> </h1><p><strong>“But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away !” (2 Tim. 3:1- 5)</strong></p><p>Last but not least, Paul warned Timothy to guard against perilous times and perilous men.  Worldly desires take over godly desires in the hearts of men.  Many will turn away from worship to self-gratification and personal indulgence.  If there was a time when these things are happening, it is now.  All around us we see this ugly phenomena.  It is time we realise that what Paul warned Timothy about is taking place right before our very eyes.</p><p>Thus, we urge you to behold the charge and guard of Paul to Timothy seriously.  Examine your lives and pace yourselves.  In the Book of Revelation we are warned by the Lord Jesus Himself to hold fast what we have, lest we lose our reward in eternity.  He would not have warned if there is no real danger of that happening.  </p><p>Be sober therefore and heed the Lord’s warning <strong>“Behold I come quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no one may take your crown” (Rev.3:11).</strong></p><h1>We pray the Father’s hands over your lives and over His calling in you!</h1>
