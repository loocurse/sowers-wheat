<h1><strong>1 &amp; 2 Peter</strong></h1><p>Apostle Peter, wrote these two letters as he neared the end of his life(2 Pet.1:12-15). This knowledge gave him a greater burden to care for the spiritual welfare of God’s people during whatever time remained.  Thus, he determined to keep on reminding the believers of the importance of Christian character and perseverance . Even if they knew, they needed to be constantly reminded, for there is always the danger of a preoccupied moment or a forgetful hour. So the truth must be constantly repeated.</p><p>This two epistle is written against a backdrop of persecution and suffering. In fact, the word “suffering” and its derivations are used twenty one times in the first epistle alone. The natural attitude for Christian is to look on suffering as abnormal, however, Peter in this two epistle is teaching us that suffering is a normal Christian life.</p><h1><strong>A Mind To Suffer </strong></h1><h1>“Since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, arm yourselves also with the same mind” (1 Pet. 4:1).  </h1><p>We are exalted to arm ourselves with the same mind as Christ as He suffered for us in the flesh. In other words, Peter was teaching us to be like Christ, to be as willing to suffer for the greater glory of God as Christ did.  Going through a suffering and having a mind to go through it are not the same.  Jesus was not forced to suffer.  He did it willingly.  This is not encouraging Christian to deliberately find opportunities to suffer, but to be prepared to suffer since our Lord has already told us that suffering will definitely come to us, and that by many trials and tribulations we shall enter the kingdom of God.  Having such a mind to suffer would mean we do not shun away from suffering, instead, we let the will of God rule our minds and we submit ourselves to His purposes for us, even if that means suffering. It means we have a heart and a willingness to endure affliction for His glory. This will enable us to submit to God’s purposes as we let His will rule our minds.  Because with the mind of Christ in place in us, our flesh remains dead – crucified with Christ. This is very important, because without a mind to suffer, we cannot withstand trials, what more overcome them.</p><p>Let us continue to dwell on the difference between one who suffers and one who has a ready mind to suffer.  Their circumstances may be the same – both suffer – but their attitudes and destinies are different.  The one who is willing to suffer is a pleasing sacrifice to God because he will find victory in his suffering, like how Jesus pleased the Father by being willing to drink the cup of suffering and found eternal victory through the painful cross.  The one who is not willing to suffer brings suffering to others as well, because he despairs as he suffers and there is no harder task on earth than trying to help a person who takes pity in his own suffering!  He may indeed be suffering, but he refuses to yield to the suffering and continues to go through the experience grudgingly.  He has not learned any lesson and his heart may be filled with rebellion and bitterness.  These lives cannot transmit the victory of Christ through their brokenness.  We can only sense death and doom as we come into contact with them.  Their tears are usually shed for themselves and never for others.</p><p>Having a mind to suffer also means loving God more than ourselves.  That love makes one willing to sacrifice self for God, and endure affliction for His sake.  Such love was demonstrated in the life of our Lord Jesus, especially during the time when He was in the Garden of Gethsemane.  If Jesus hadn’t had the mind to suffer, then He wouldn’t have yielded Himself to the Cross of Calvary.  But because Jesus loved God more than He loved Himself, He was willing to suffer for the purposes of God.  And because of that willingness to suffer, we are here today, coming to God unafraid and uncondemned.  Thus, a mind to suffer is a settled decision within oneself to be on the Lord’s side, no matter what the future may hold and no matter what circumstances one may encounter.  On the contrary, one who is not prepared to suffer for God will end up sacrificing or compromising the Lord’s work.  For that person would be too busy indulging in self-pity and loving himself over the needs of the Lord’s ministry.  The danger is, those who love themselves are truly bound by themselves.  They succumb to their flesh and weaknesses in trials and lack the strength to overcome.  Do we value our earthly lives more than our calling in Christ?  Is fulfilling our calling less important than fulfilling our thirst for pleasure and comfort?  Anyone who loves himself more than God will never be able to worship God wholly.  According to Jesus, such people is not even worthy to follow Him.  We need to review our hearts from time to time.  The degree to which we are willing to suffer will ultimately determine the extent of our service unto God.</p><h1>Suffering as God’s Priming Tool</h1><p>Don’t we often blame our sufferings on the circumstances we appear to be trapped in?  Don’t we often think that only if our circumstances were different, we'd be able to get it right and not suffer adversities?  We won’t go into a debate on this, but we believe that God’s desire is for us, His children, to grow in Him and grow in maturity such that we live victoriously even in times of trials, even when the conditions are not conducive or worse, hostile.  While we always believe that God has the power and the authority to deliver us out of any affliction, we also respect that the sovereignty of God sometimes allows us to go through periods of trials so that we can grow from faith to faith, from glory to glory.  Rather than help us get rid of a problem, He guides us in overcoming life’s challenges.  Don’t you think this might require greater faith than waiting to be delivered out of a situation?  That, too, is a grace of God.  When our suffering abounds, God’s grace also abounds.  What an assurance we have in Him!  Let us not only marvel at the mighty power of God to deliver from the fire or flood, but let us be reminded to give thanks for His faithfulness that keeps His children, His patience that comforts us, and His grace that strengthens us.  Suffering can be a tool God uses to prime us for His purposes in our lives.  </p><h1>Suffering Defined</h1><p>To put it simply, suffering is anything that pains, hurts or disturbs, in various degrees.  It can be itching acutely from an ant bite or agonizing from a lion’s bite.  It can be a normal sore throat or a throat cancer.  Whatever its form, suffering is definitely not a pleasant thing.  So why does God still allow suffering?  We believe our understanding is not complete on this issue (because God’s mind is infinite), but the following are some reasons we believe why we are allowed to suffer.</p><h2>Suffering tests our faith</h2><p>Peter knows that the disciples of Christ will go through various trials and persecutions, so in the light of their suffering, he said to them <strong>“In this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if need be, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ…” (1 Pet. 6:7).</strong>  Peter is telling us, first the Cross, then the Crown! The object and quality of your faith are proven as you rise above the sufferance trials bring.  It is easier for men to live right when conditions are favorable than to live right when the conditions are adverse.  The prophet Jeremiah asks, <strong>“If you have run with the footmen, and they have wearied you, then how can you contend with horses?  And if in the land of peace, in which you trusted, they wearied you, then how will do in the floodplain of the Jordan?” (Jer. 12:5)</strong>.  Similarly, many of us may think that we are all right until we are tested, then we find out exactly how strong or how weak our allegiance to God is.  Even Jesus learnt obedience this way: <strong>“though He was a Son, yet He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.” (Heb 5:8).</strong>  Suffering can indeed be God’s pruning tool to remove the ungodly qualities in us – sins committed in ignorance, immature attitudes and behavior, wrong values, self-centeredness, etc.  The goal is increased fruitfulness in our lives, so that our faith in God really flourishes.  </p><h3>Suffering turns us towards Heaven</h3><p>Renown evangelist, Guy Napoleon Woods said, <em>“Martyrs, in the hour of persecution and death, do not toy with temptations or surrender to the seductions of the world.”</em>  Very true, won’t you agree?  Too often, Christians don’t realize how well they fare to be counted citizens of heaven until someone on earth comes along and hurt us.  Then we start to pine for the Lord’s return when He can take all of us up to heaven with Him where we shall be free from the world’s torture forever and ever!  But if suffering does not come to men on earth, then who would be craving for heaven?  If all is fair and well for us, won’t you and I be happy to just live the rest of our lives this way?  But God knows of a better place to settle His children: <strong>“Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul.” (1Pet. 2:11).</strong>  Have some of us forgotten that we are only temporary citizens of this world?  Most of us do, from time to time.  But when suffering hurts us, we wake up immediately and this world suddenly becomes less attractive to us and heaven becomes so inviting.  Thus, God allows the cruel reality of this world to pinch us or even knock us to wake us up so that we don’t forget our destiny up there.  </p><h1>Suffering brings out the best in us</h1><p>We <strong>“also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope.” (Rom. 5:3-4).</strong>  Listen to the life testimonies of several great men and you’ll see that the turning points of their lives where the greatest achievements came about are also the breaking points of their lives.  What did the Lord say to Apostle Paul when he requested for the thorn in his flesh to be removed?  <strong>“My strength is made perfect in weakness.” (2 Cor. 12:9).</strong></p><h1>Suffering breaks down our pride/self-sufficiency</h1><p>When things move out of our control and we are unable to do anything else apart from enduring the course, we start to forsake our pride and turn to God for help.  Suffering forces us to turn from our resources to God’s resources.  Some of us call this brokenness.  God is not scheming to break our spirits and dash it to pieces, but He wants to break our flesh, the force that is obstructing His will to be one with us.  Suffering is a useful tool for tearing down God-unfriendly traits like pride, willfulness, independence and rebellion.  He wants us to be totally dependent on Him and sadly, for a civilization that is so advance, it takes brokenness to bring us to that point<strong>.  “He will sit as a refiner and a purifier of silver; He will purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer to the Lord an offering in righteousness.” (Mal. 3:3).</strong>  Rather than lead us to deeper despair, it brings us nearer to the glory of God. Thus, we need not be afraid of suffering, because we know that they are not eternal, yet they bring about an eternal reward.</p><h1><strong>Suffering trains compassion in us.</strong></h1><p>Very often, compassion is born out of similar experiences.  Jesus Himself was described in this manner, <strong>“For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin.” (Heb. 4:15).</strong>  Having gone through trials and seen how God guided us through them equip us with greater compassion to minister to those in similar circumstances.  God never creates waste.  Our suffering is never in vain because it helps us to <strong>“rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.” (Rom. 12:15).</strong>  So, though God allows suffering to enter our lives, He <strong>“comforts us in all our tribulation, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any trouble, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by (Him).” (1 Cor. 1:4).</strong></p><h1>Suffering moulds our prayers</h1><p>We may have started praying since the day we knew the Lord, but when trials come, they teach us to pray in a way that we otherwise wouldn’t know about.  We can testify that we learn much more about prayer out of a period of suffering than we ever did in the rest of our life.  A believer’s prayers can be vastly changed when he has been through suffering.  So besides strengthening our faith, suffering also mature our prayers.  If this were not so, it would be hard to explain why the Bible contains a whole book on Lamentations.  The way a broken person speaks to God is different from that spoken by one who has never been broken.  </p><h4>Suffering enlarges our tents</h4><p>Do not be surprised – our sufferings can contain an opportunity for God to broaden our ministries.  Take Apostle Paul for example.  While he was imprisoned in his own house and guarded closely by Roman soldiers, the time of suffering gave him the opportunity to spread the gospel of Christ within the elite palace guard: <strong>“But I want you to know, brethren, that the things which happened to me have actually turned out for the furtherance of the gospel, so that it has become evident to the whole palace guard, and to the rest, that my chains are in Christ; and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.” (Phil. 1:12-14).</strong>   What did you think Paul did while he suffered imprisonment?  If he had been sulking, complaining and feeling bitter, would the Roman guards have been moved by his testimony?  Apparently, they were amazed at how Paul was rejoicing in the Lord in spite of his suffering!  Paul was steadfast in his faith and look at what an effect suffering had on his ministry!  Not only did it result in the spread of the gospel to the unbelievers, it strengthened the faith of believers and gave them the confidence to advance God’s kingdom!  </p><h2>Let us be steadfast!</h2><p>Since we begin with a mind ready to suffer, what kind of attitude should we adopt in times of suffering so that we may emerge victorious over them all?  How do we do what is right so that we do not crumble under the pressure of those trials that come to crush us?  Therefore, being steadfast in our faith is crucial.</p><h1>Think about our heavenly inheritance</h1><p>Friends, if our eyes are set on the things of heaven, that will help us go through the trials of this world.  But if there is no heavenly hope or eternal inheritance awaiting us, we might as well perish in our suffering.  Think about it, we were redeemed by God Himself, nothing less.  If we realized just how much we mean to God, and we will be assured that your present suffering is not in vain.  God is definitely preparing us for something greater, something beyond our imagination right now, but we will see His plan if we endure the present moment.  If God has taken us lightly, He would not have sent His precious Son to die that violent death for us <strong>“knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold…but with the precious blood of Christ” (1Pet.1:18-19)</strong>  Jesus waited and suffered for 33 years just to reconcile us to God!  For this reason, surely we can endure whatever comes, can’t we?  </p><p>What is God preparing us for?  The heavenly inheritance!  God is preparing us for <strong>“an inheritance incorruptible and undefiled and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you.” (1 Pet. 1:4).  “And when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away.” (1 Pet. 5:4)</strong></p><h1>Think about the faithfulness of God</h1><p>Though God is omnipotent and there is nothing impossible with Him, yet He had His limitation. There is something that God cannot do and wouldn’t do. God is light and God is truth, in Him there is no shadow of darkness, so God cannot and He doesn’t lie.  God’s Word is trustworthy and we can rest fully in His promises.  <strong>“The Lord is not slack concerning His promise…” (2 Pet. 3:9).</strong>  No matter how mature one is in the faith, we all need to learn to trust God.  Hear it from the prophet Nahum, <strong>“The Lord is good, a stronghold in the day of trouble; and He knows those who trust in Him.” (Nahum 1:7).</strong>  God is there, as a pillar of strength for us in our troubles and suffering.  In order to handle any form of suffering with peace and tranquility, we must be able to respect God’s purposes and reasons for them.  We must have faith in God’s eternal verities.  We cannot doubt him like we doubt humans!  We will find strength to continue joyfully in our trials if we read and meditate on God’s Word, for that gives us strength. <strong> “Great peace have those who love Your law, and nothing causes them to stumble.” (Ps. 119:165)  </strong>Stop hearing only to what the world says, what the media reports and what others may forecast.  Rest in the Word of God and let it sustain you in times of trials.</p><h1>Remember that our sufferings are measured</h1><p>No matter how severe they feel, our sufferings have their limits.  Do not ever think God is uninterested or simply choosing to stay uninvolved in our problems.  Nothing can be further from the truth!  God watches faithfully over each and every one of His children, don’t we know?  He knows the abilities of us better than we do and according to His knowledge and wisdom, God sets careful limits to what He allows us to endure!  Don’t think like an unbeliever.  The unbeliever has no assurance that what he is going through is measured and will be bearable, but we do!  Take note what Paul says in 1 Cor. 10:13, <strong>“God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able but with the temptation will also make the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.”  </strong>We can trust God with our lives.  He will never put us through more than what we can take.</p><h1>Remember to pray</h1><p>When in times of suffering, the surest way to perish in the suffering is to give up praying.  But if we want to overcome the trials, then we need to pray all the more!  Our Lord Jesus prayed in the garden of Gethsemane and He found the strength to drink from the cup God had given Him.  When the early church was persecuted, the people prayed fervently until God delivered them from the perils.  </p><p>Remember that our Lord suffered more than any man, but to the greater glory of God.  Jesus Himself said to us, <strong>“In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.”  (John 16:33).</strong>  Understanding the reasons for our suffering and having the assurance of our final victory in Christ should help us enjoy lives better, even in the midst of suffering.  </p><p>Though we now understand the purposes and principles of suffering, and are aware of God’s promises of enduring love and goodwill to the end, handling trials when they come will still not be easy.  When suffering strikes, it is still going to hurt, regardless of how much we know of it.  So, being armed with a mind prepared for suffering will help us handle the difficult times better.  Paul’s charge to us is that <strong>“no one should be shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed to this.” (1 Thess. 3:3).  </strong></p><p>In any case, we always have God with us, no matter how rough the times, thus Peter says, “<strong>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.” (1 Pet. 4:19)</strong></p><h2>Warning Against False Teachings</h2><p>In the opening of Peter’s second letter, his attention turned to false teachers and the need to beware of them.  He talks about their scheme (how they come to deceive Christians) and he also talks about their destructive destiny.  Through it all, Peter’s final exhortation to the Christians is for all of us to be well grounded in the truth of God’s Word so that we will not be led away by falsehood.</p><p>The term that Peter used to refer to false teacher is the word  which means “spurious teacher” – one who teaches and spreads a perverse doctrine out of sinful intentions.  Jesus did talk about a situation where blind leads blind (Matt. 15:13-14) but that is not what Peter was referring to in his letter.  Here, Peter is not talking about someone who is ignorant of the truth and therefore teaches an erroneous doctrine.  He is talking about someone who knows what he teaches is wrong yet goes on teaching it, with the intention to mislead others into falsehood and deception!  It is a much more serious case than the former, because it tells of a heart that is not right, that is deceitful and seeks to destroy God’s work among men.</p><h1>Recognizing False Teachers</h1><p>Peter tells us how we can recognize false teachers.  Firstly, their doctrines appeal to the covetousness of men. The doctrine draws out the covetousness of the flesh and focuses on self-gratification rather than the glory of God.  The cross is often absent in their teachings.  Secondly, they will use deceptive words to mislead people.  <strong>“By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words…” (2 Pet. 2:3).  </strong></p><p>The teachings of false teachers draw a man’s attention away from the things of God and appeal instead to the cravings of his flesh.  <strong>“…they allure through the lusts of the flesh,” (2 Pet 2:18).</strong>  They will say that it is not wrong to crave money, comfort, pleasures etc.  Contrary to God’s truth, they appeal to whatever the flesh stands to gain.  God’s principles seek to protect His children from harm, but the teachings of falsehood seek to lead us into an aimless chase after the things of this world. </p><p>False teachers also deviate from God’s Word.  As Peter has pointed out, they use deceptive words, <strong>“For when they speak great swelling words of emptiness…” (2 Pet. 2:18).</strong>  Their speech is smooth and eloquent.  They do not pause or stammer over what they want to say. They often impress with charisma and “anointing”.  Let’s be wise and discerning <strong>“But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, and bring on themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their destructive ways, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed. By covetousness they will exploit you with deceptive words…”(2 Pet.2:1- 3).</strong></p><p>We should also beware of their scheme for they have<strong> “eyes full of adultery and that cannot cease from sin, beguiling unstable souls. They have a heart trained in covetous practices…”(2 Pet.2:14).  </strong>Our best protection against false teaching is to be grounded in the truth of God’s Word and to <strong>“continue steadfastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship…” (Act 2:42).  </strong>Let no one confuse you by telling you more than what God’s Word says.  Hold fast to the truth in God’s Word and let it come alive in us, bearing fruits of the Spirit of God so that we do not end up like how<strong> “A dog returns to his own vomit,” and “ a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire.” (2Pet.2:22)</strong></p><p>Let us head the warning of Peter seriously <strong>“You, therefore, beloved, since you know these things beforehand, beware lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being led away with the error of the wicked; but grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and forever. Amen” (2Pet.3:17-18)</strong></p>
