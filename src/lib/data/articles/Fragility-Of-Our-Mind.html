<h1><strong>Fragility Of Our Mind</strong></h1><p>Once, I had a dream.  In that dream, I was walking with a friend along a dark lane when suddenly two greenish butterfly-like creatures loomed in front of us and immediately zipped fixedly in our direction.  My friend was very swift to respond and with a wave of his hand, deftly smacked down one of the winged-attackers.  I, on the other hand, made no offensive moves but merely ducked away from them, thus giving one of them the opportunity to land on me.  Before I knew it, the creature that landed on my scalp quickly disappeared into my head!  I began to feel a couple of lens covering the pupils of my eyes, as if drawing a shield over them.  In just a matter of moments after that, my vision became subject to this involuntary pair of lens that grew over my eyes.  Everything I saw after that was seen through that pair of lens.  There was no way I could escape from that.  If that pair of lens were dark, then the world around me appeared dim and shadowed in my sight!</p><p>Gradually, the voice of the Lord’s Spirit began speaking to me: “The flying objects you have just seen are fiery darts that carry the devil’s thoughts.  They are roaming the surroundings, seeking for a mind to make their dwelling place.  Once catching anyone off guard, these darts will pierce and infiltrate that person’s mind.  They will then influence and transform his mind, all the while driving his thoughts away from the truth, and towards degeneration.  The thoughts will also direct and drive his actions and life in the way the devil wants them to be.  Therefore be alert and vigilant; beware the devil’s scheme to destroy.  Be alert to sweep them down the moment you detect them.”  That, I suppose, is the only protection we can take against these fiery darts.  Like what Paul said in 2 Cor. 10:4 – 5,  <strong>“the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down argument and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ ….”</strong></p><p>However hard we try, it is very difficult to compartmentalise godly inspiration and evil temptations and keep them neatly away from each other.  The Holy Spirit breathes inspiration into our spirit who in turn absorbs the breath of God and sends an intelligible communication to our mind so that we can “walk according to God in the Spirit” (1 Pet. 4:6).  However, the devil also speaks to us by sowing thoughts in our minds and stirring them to influence and bend our actions and lives.  So we see that the battle really takes place not in our work place or in our homes, but the fight goes on fiercely up there in our minds.  If the truth were known, we will realise how heavily our minds are being shelled or fired in the spiritual realm.  Indeed, the believer’s mind is the organ most susceptible to open fire and, ours are being attacked much more frequently and in a measure more intense than we can ever imagine.  Knowing now that such a battlefield exists right on the planes of our mind, it is thus ever so crucial for us to observe a clean thought-life and put our guard up against any thought or way that defies the precepts of God.  It is high time we stand up to the enemy’s darts and bring their every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ (2 Cor. 10:5).</p><p>While visiting Australia, I was having my breakfast one morning when a seagull hovered, apparently eyeing my food.  I shoved her away each time she drew within reach, but she persisted nevertheless.  After some time, it became clear that the seagull would not go for as long as there is food on the table.  On that same analogy, the presence of the seagull is like the presence of evil spirits.  Like how food on the table keeps the presence of the seagull, so unwholesome thoughts make the mind a perfect attractive place for demonic influence. </p><p>If we do not want to invite ‘demonic seagulls’ into our lives, we have to keep the ‘table’ of our mind free from the food that will attract them.  Too many of us have the “food” of bitterness, anger, lust, covetous ,etc, which are no doubt Satan’s ‘favourite foods’.  This being so, it is little wonder why his presence continues to hang around.  For Bible exhorts us to keep only “healthy food” on the table of our mind: <strong>“Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, is there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy-mediate on these things.” (Phil.4:8)</strong></p><p>Our lives are also very much influenced by the company we keep.<strong>  “He who walks with wise men will be wise, but the companion of fools will be destroyed.”(Prov.13:20)</strong>  Surely, we must realise by now that a personality attract its kind.  Birds of the same feathers flock together, so we say.  When we keep our minds clean and holy, our lives become an invitation to godly people who also brings along with them the communion of the Holy Spirit, thus giving us healthy fellowship that edifies and builds constructively.  Conversely, an unwholesome and stained mind invites persons of like perversity who brings along with them another aspect of perversion.  We can almost be sure the end result of the man who finds himself in the company of the warped will be worse than what he was before.</p><p>Thus, a mind set on the holiness of God and the renewing of the mind is the key to walking effectively with the Lord and to discerning the schemes of the enemy.  Let us lay aside everything that defiles the mind and lay to heart only that which is true, noble, just, pure, lovely, of good virtue and praiseworthy (that) the peace of God will be with us always (Phil. 4:8-9). </p>
